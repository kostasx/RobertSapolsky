1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,930


2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,791
Stanford University.

3
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:08,290
--started.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,370


5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,900
See some exam-related
announcements.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,190
First off, there are the
statistics, mean and median,

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,739
which, in terms of
numbers and what

8
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,280
they mean-- what
they mean in my book

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,130
is that people are doing
a good job in here.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,990
So, good going.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,830
Also having done an amazing
job are the TAs, who, other

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,500
than coming to
class here, have not

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,470
been allowed out of
the conference room

14
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,680
since you left your
exams with them.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
They have screamed with the
repetitiveness of grading

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,510
the same question 550 times.

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,940
And they worked really hard
to get this back to you

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,420
guys in time for
decisions about pass,

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,090
no credit-- that sort of thing.

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,192
So these guys did yet
another amazing job.

21
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:58,160
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,128
Yay, TAs.

23
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,300


24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,800
Let's see.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,100
The other thing is, the
exams will be outside,

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,340
at the end of class.

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,900
A to M is upstairs, and
the rest of those letters

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,010
are downstairs.

29
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,886
So start figuring
out which you are.

30
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:21,360
The TAs will be flinging boxes
of exams around out there, so

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,520
go get yours afterward.

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,720
Again, people did a good job.

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,700
OK, picking up on our by now
sickeningly familiar time

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,450
core strategy thing, here,
we left off on Friday,

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,700
way to the left, in our very
last area of sexual behavior

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,490
and the logic there is--
ooh, somewhere along the way

37
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,710
we mentioned genes,
or we mentioned

38
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,730
a hormone, or a receptor,
or whatever, and thus

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,290
were immediately talking
about the evolution thereof,

40
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,300
all the way back.

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,550
What does natural
selection theory

42
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,620
tell us about the evolution
of sexual behavior?

43
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,410
And what we've been
doing is bouncing

44
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,100
between the two genders,
in terms of strategies,

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,680
starting off with
the basic asymmetry

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,639
of caloric expenditure on sperm
versus an egg plus a pregnancy,

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,360
plus, in most species,
raising the offspring.

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,780
All of that giving rise
to the famed promiscuity

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,450
on the part of males-- the
lower levels of pickiness.

50
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,960
What we saw was the role
of male-male competition

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,080
and making sense
of behaviors that

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,550
are involved in passing
on more copies of genes.

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,670
We have also seen all
sorts of male strategies

54
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,900
for decreasing the reproductive
success of competitors

55
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,950
and, in the same
process, decreasing

56
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,880
that of females for the future.

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,280
And female counterstrategies
in a lot of those cases.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,190
What we also then
transitioned to

59
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,840
was what female choice
was about, even in species

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,440
that were tournament species.

61
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,440
And what we transition
to now is looking

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,040
at aspects of
female-female competition,

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,060
in terms of sexual reproduction.

64
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,500
What you see is--
predominantly in species

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,230
that are pair-bonding,
that are monogamous--

66
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,860
what you see is the
potential for a great deal

67
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,460
of female-female competition
for access to males.

68
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,180
That ironic turn
of events where,

69
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,830
if the whole system
works-- where

70
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,670
you give birth and
the guy who believes

71
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,806
he's the father is going to
be taken care of the kids,

72
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,900
and what you want is
someone who is good at that,

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,290
is confident at that, can act
maternal in a convincing way,

74
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,340
and thus is subject to a
whole lot of competition

75
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,840
on the part of females.

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,020
And thus what you get
is selection pressures

77
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,260
in those species-- New World
monkeys, for example-- a lot

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,420
of bird species--
selection pressures.

79
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,490
Where, if anything,
it's the females

80
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,930
who wind up being more
aggressive than the males.

81
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,690
The females who tend
to have the larger body

82
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,060
size, who have the
more pronounced

83
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,160
secondary sexual
characteristics.

84
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,530
What's that about?

85
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,280
It's females competing with
females for males to pick them,

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,930
exactly the opposite scenario
as in most of the species

87
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,950
we've been hearing about.

88
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,860
OK.

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,760
What this then brings us to
is the next great question,

90
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,820
which already I've
had a lot of people

91
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,880
ask me during breaks-- all
the way back way there,

92
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,910
in terms of making
sense of the evolution

93
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,519
of this type of sexual
behavior and that type

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,470
and the other type, in terms of
passing on copies of your genes

95
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,178
and you and your
relatives-- all of that.

96
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,810
Which brings you, inevitably,
to the question of, well, what

97
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,000
about the evolution
of homosexuality?

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,100
Because this has
always been the puzzle

99
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,350
in the book of zoologist,
evolutionary biologist,

100
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,270
et cetera, trying
to make sense of all

101
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,440
of this in the
context of adaptation

102
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,430
and passing on copies of
genes, especially when you

103
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,010
see how widespread this
is in lots and lots

104
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,390
and lots of other species.

105
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,800
What's up with that?

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,260
Because, up until
relatively recent times,

107
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,870
across virtually every
culture out there,

108
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,620
gay men had a much fewer
number of copies of genes,

109
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,980
on the average, that
they were passing on.

110
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,890
How could this trait
to be so universal?

111
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,580
And best estimates are 5% to
20% rate in every human culture

112
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,670
ever looked at.

113
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,610
So what's the
selection for that?

114
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,520
Or why hasn't that
been selected against?

115
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,220
Basically, there's
been three theories

116
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,700
that have floated around.

117
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,660
And all of them are predicated
on one very simple fact that

118
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,830
still is not all
that factual, which

119
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,290
is that there is a
genetic component to one's

120
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,790
sexual orientation.

121
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,480
And we already heard all
sorts of bits of evidence

122
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,840
about prenatal endocrine
environment that

123
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,550
argues in other directions.

124
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,020
We have already heard that there
have been those studies which

125
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,940
find covariance of
sexual orientation

126
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,700
in identical twins
versus nonidentical--

127
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,460
finding a genetic marker,
but one that nobody else

128
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,730
is able to replicate.

129
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,460
So everything now is
predicated on the notion

130
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,310
that, well, genes have at
least a little bit of something

131
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,730
to do with it.

132
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,170
So, three theories that
have floated around,

133
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,780
first one being the
heterozygotic-vigor argument.

134
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,470
Lots of folks will
recognize that

135
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,080
from other realms of genetics.

136
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,420
That's the deal where you
can have certain traits which

137
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,810
can be in the homozygotic form
or in the heterozygotic form.

138
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,900
And people who are
new to this, go back

139
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,420
and check your notes from
the Mendel genetics catch-up

140
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,170
sections.

141
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,300
And what you see is,
with lots of diseases

142
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,820
you get an extreme version
is indeed a disease

143
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,830
and a partial version
is, in fact, adaptive.

144
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,540
And the classic example
that always gets trotted out

145
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,390
is sickle-cell anemia--
full-blown homozygotic version,

146
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,350
horrible hematological disorder;
partial, heterozygotic version,

147
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,100
resistance to malaria and a
gazillion diseases out there.

148
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,610
And what's done
is metaphorically

149
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,610
running the same argument of
saying, whatever gene genes are

150
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,870
relevant, maybe the
homozygotic form

151
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,770
is the one that produces a
behavioral phenotype which

152
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,150
decreases reproductive success.

153
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,500
But there's some
heterozygotic form

154
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,010
which has some huge advantage
and enough of one to outweigh

155
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,830
the one-fourth of the
relatives who wind up

156
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,700
with the homozygotic version.

157
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,510
So that's one model, for which
there is very little evidence.

158
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,840
Next one.

159
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Next one is a gender-dependent
genetic argument, as follows.

160
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,040
It is a trait.

161
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,840
It is a genetically
influenced trait

162
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,790
which, when expressed
in one gender,

163
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,870
is maladaptive and decreases
reproductive success.

164
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,210
But when it is expressed
in the other gender,

165
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,130
it is highly adaptive and
increases reproductive success.

166
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,650
And you can immediately run
your numbers argument there

167
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,440
that, as long as the benefits
for the other kind of sibling

168
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,600
or gender is larger
than the detriment here,

169
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,530
this is going to
be selected for.

170
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,850
What would that look like?

171
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,880
Where is the evidence for that?

172
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,210
What one would predict is that
you would see, for gay men,

173
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,230
that their sisters have
a higher-than-average

174
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,710
reproductive rate.

175
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,900
And that is absolutely
there in the literature.

176
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,440
So the people who push
for this view would say,

177
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,180
aha, there is some sort
of trait which, in a male,

178
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,240
increases the likelihood,
manifesting as homosexuality

179
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,260
in a female, as some
route by which there is

180
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,210
increased reproductive success.

181
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,080
The third model is the
"helper at the nest" model,

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,890
which is that the individual
who traditionally is not

183
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,710
passing on copies
of their own genes

184
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,919
directly-- instead,
what they're doing

185
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,790
is expending resources on
helping their siblings.

186
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,820
OK, so that kind of sounds
like the second model, also.

187
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,110
What's the difference?

188
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,080
The second model says
that sisters of gay men

189
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,420
should have increased
reproductive rates.

190
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,700
What the third model--
the "helping at the nest"

191
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,300
model-- suggests is,
both sisters and brothers

192
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,530
should have increased
reproductive rates.

193
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,370
And that's actually
what's mostly been seen.

194
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,520
So, support for this "helper
at the nest" kin-selection

195
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,890
kind of argument.

196
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,570
OK.

197
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,950
What else does one look
for in a mate, besides all

198
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,960
of the stuff that males
are competing about

199
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,330
and females in
pair-bonding species?

200
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,180
What are some of the
characteristics that

201
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,210
pop up over and over again,
when it's getting around

202
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,690
to who looks good to you, if
you are a damselfly trying

203
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,360
to pick out a mate, and in
all these other species?

204
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,930
One initial
characteristic, which

205
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,100
is the famed role of facial
symmetry in attractiveness.

206
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,340
This has an interesting
history, and this goes back

207
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,710
to the 19th century.

208
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,460
And there was some
guy-- who was it?

209
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,830
It was Francis Galton.

210
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,330
Was it?

211
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,990


212
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,850
Maybe.

213
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,850
And it was Francis
Galton, I think,

214
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,420
who was having--
no, it couldn't be.

215
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,054
They didn't have-- forget that.

216
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:04,970
Don't write that down.

217
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,570
There was some guy in
the 19th century who

218
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:14,150
was a famous criminologist and
was pushing a classic nonsense

219
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,840
theory of the time, which is
that there is a criminal face

220
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,260
and that people who are really
skilled police people could

221
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,200
to look at somebody's face
beforehand and immediately

222
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,640
predict that this is
someone who is going

223
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,600
to commit a criminal
act, inevitably,

224
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,150
at some-- all sorts of nonsense.

225
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,630
Genetic determinism and
racism and [INAUDIBLE]

226
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,160
biases of all sorts
running through there.

227
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,310
Complete nonsense-- yet one
of the dominant intellectual

228
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,890
models in criminology
in the 19th century

229
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,910
was that there are facial
characteristics that

230
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,720
are typical of criminals.

231
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,340
So this was this individual
who decided to come up

232
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,810
with the archetypal face of
what a criminal looks like

233
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,740
and managed to get photographs
of the faces of a whole bunch

234
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,140
of different criminals,
pulling them out of the jail

235
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,630
or whatever and taking a picture
with the newly invented camera.

236
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,410
And, through some technique that
clearly was some proto Adobe

237
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,920
Photoshop sort of
ancestor thing,

238
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,660
was able to overlap the
faces in order to come up

239
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,120
with a composite face.

240
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,430
And this composite face
was now going to tell you,

241
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,040
this is the most
criminal-looking face

242
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,150
that anybody has ever seen.

243
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,650
And that's not what happened.

244
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,720
Instead, everybody
looked at that face

245
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,670
and said, hey, that guy's
kind of good-looking!

246
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,100
That guy is, in fact,
really good-looking.

247
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,400
And had just stumbled on
this interesting thing that,

248
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,180
when you average faces, when
you toss them all together,

249
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,200
that when you merge
them, they look

250
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,190
more attractive
than the individuals

251
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,270
that they came from-- when
you make composite pictures.

252
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,960
And this has kept all sorts of
people happy doing experiments

253
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,320
where they do mixes and
matches of starting with 100

254
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,870
different pictures of people
and combine subsets of them

255
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,420
and having people rating
attractiveness and stuff.

256
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,360
And it's this absolutely
bizarre thing--

257
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,490
that the more faces that go
into a composite, the more,

258
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,760
on the average, people perceive
them as being attractive,

259
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,700
amid incredibly
subtle differences

260
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,910
between a composite picture
of 50 faces versus 25,

261
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,760
all of that, people are able to
pick up the differences-- not

262
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,490
necessarily consciously.

263
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,530
So what is that about?

264
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,254
And what became clear,
many decades later,

265
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:39,670
is that what happens
when you make

266
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,340
a lot of faces all
into one composite

267
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,350
is you get a highly
symmetrical face.

268
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,810
And this seems to be the
key thing that comes through

269
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,720
in that realm of attractiveness.

270
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,580
Which is that, when you average
in a whole lot of faces,

271
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,330
one of the things you average
is the averageness of the face.

272
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,250
And you get rid of asymmetries.

273
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,620
And everyone knows that-- who
would you want to mate with?

274
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,120
[LAUGHTER]

275
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,460
OK, so, thereby
proving the point.

276
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,500
And what you've got is,
symmetry is apparently

277
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,720
a good, reliable
marker of health.

278
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,070
Wildly asymmetric
faces are typically

279
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,820
the result of complications--
developmental ones-- health

280
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,780
sort of issues.

281
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,630
So the general interpretation
is that symmetry is attractive

282
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,790
because it is a
marker of health.

283
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,760
And every single
article you will ever

284
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,987
read in sort of the
lay press-- or even

285
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,570
in some of the science
journals, which

286
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,070
should be above
this sort of thing--

287
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,580
will have the picture of some
famously attractive somebody

288
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,340
or other, with
the face up there,

289
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,950
and all the little caliper
markings, and showing

290
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,760
the same sizes, and then
some poor schnook who's

291
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,170
chosen to be the asymmetric
face who's stuck up there.

292
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,420
Did the Newsweek article wind
up being in the readings?

293
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,380
No, it wasn't-- yes.

294
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,530
OK.

295
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,670
Lyle Lovett-- is that
the face they had there

296
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,630
that they were making vicious
fun of and pointing out

297
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,540
lip asymmetries and such?

298
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,730
Something about the symmetry
seems to be a marker for health

299
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,390
and is considered
more attractive.

300
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,720
And people can pick up
astonishingly subtle

301
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,620
asymmetries in faces.

302
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,240
Babies, at two
months of age, show--

303
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,680
when you are doing
morphed faces,

304
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,350
composite faces, where you
can very minorly adjust

305
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,750
the degree of symmetry or
asymmetry in the face-- babies,

306
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,030
at two months of
age, are already

307
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,500
preferring to look at pictures
of more symmetrical faces.

308
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,730
You find this in lots of
other species, as well.

309
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,040
When you look at
animals lever-pressing--

310
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,830
rats, for example,
getting access

311
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,530
to other rats of
the opposite gender.

312
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,380
And you will see there's
a bias for symmetry there.

313
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,470
There is a bias in
nonhuman primates

314
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,290
for more symmetrical faces.

315
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,480
How's this for a
nutty study that

316
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,380
was published about five
years ago, in Nature?

317
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,290
And this one reported that
people who had symmetrical

318
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,200
faces were better dancers.

319
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,450
OK, let's work through that one.

320
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,090
What was that one about?

321
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,090
And they did-- it
was a bizarre study,

322
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,050
but somehow, nonetheless,
it was irresistible.

323
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,070
Here's what they showed.

324
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,030
They filmed all sorts
of people dancing.

325
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,380
And, no doubt, they
did perfect controls

326
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,540
and they, like,
made sure everybody

327
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,570
danced to the same
thing, which was,

328
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,660
like-- oh, I don't
know-- something--

329
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,390
a scientist rapping
to something or other.

330
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,090
And people dancing away, there.

331
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,729
And then they used
this amazing technique,

332
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,520
which I didn't understand
in the slightest,

333
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,960
with some sort of
camera-capture technique

334
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,780
that would make everybody
dancing look like Gumby.

335
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,080
So you took out all the
individual features-- anything

336
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,600
at all.

337
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
And people would then
rate them on the dancing.

338
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,350
And it would turn
out that people

339
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,320
who were rated by both
genders, of either gender,

340
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,630
as being a better
dancer, when you then

341
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,860
went and checked out
their faces afterward,

342
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,950
with your slide rule, turned out
to have more symmetrical faces.

343
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,790
Whoa!

344
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,260
Isn't that bizarre?

345
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,020
My guess would be that this is
one of those indirect routes

346
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,210
that we've already
seen some examples of.

347
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,270
My guess would be,
more symmetrical faces

348
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,660
are thus more attractive,
and thus such people

349
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,090
are treated better and
are more confident in life

350
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,142
and more extroverted and
more comfortable dancing

351
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:37,600
when they knew that
they were going

352
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,230
to wind up looking like Gumby.

353
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,520
So that is probably what
the indirect route is.

354
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,630
But running through all of
this is this symmetry business.

355
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,940
And it's there in
species after species.

356
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,210
And humans are amazing at
picking up subtleties at it.

357
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,360
One additional finding in
the symmetry world-- women

358
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,100
at the time that
they are ovulating

359
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,246
have their faces become ever
so slightly more symmetrical.

360
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:06,329
[COMMENTS AMONG  STUDENTS]

361
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,310
OK, well, that's
going to get people

362
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,270
all nutsy in the
coming weeks, no doubt,

363
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,400
trying to figure out
what that's about.

364
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,040
I did not see a good explanation
as to what that was about,

365
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,770
but that has been observed
in the literature.

366
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,920
So the first thing,
in terms of what

367
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,960
one looks for in
a mate, if you're

368
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,170
some basic social animal-- first
set of features, this business

369
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,890
about symmetry.

370
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,430
Next realm-- this whole
world of secondary sexual

371
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,960
characteristics.

372
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,800
Why is it that female
peacocks like male peacocks

373
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,620
to look like male peacocks,
and all that sort of thing?

374
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,180
What is that about?

375
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,980
And people have been working
with this one for years.

376
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,520
And there is a
zoologist named Zahavi

377
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,270
who has been very influential--
Israeli zoologist--

378
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,700
who came up with what is called
the "handicap principle."

379
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
As follows.

380
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,400
Why is it that secondary sexual
characteristics are appealing?

381
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,450
Characteristics that exaggerate
the difference in appearance

382
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,470
by gender.

383
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,500
Why is that appealing?

384
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,570
Because, in effect, the bigger
and more garish and the more

385
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,700
over-the-top your secondary
sexual characteristic is,

386
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,050
the more you were
communicating to the world,

387
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,610
I have so much energy on
board, and I am so healthy,

388
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,090
that I can afford to squander
massive numbers of calories

389
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,410
on these asinine neon antlers
I'm walking around with.

390
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,530
That it's an argument
there that this

391
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,780
is a display of, in a sense,
conspicuous consumption--

392
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,110
the ability to put energy into
these large secondary sexual

393
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,990
characteristics.

394
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,940
That these are markers of health
and of good immune systems.

395
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,790
Lots of evidence for this.

396
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,170
And this is, by now, a whole
field that people have studied.

397
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,690
One version of it.

398
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,151
These were studies done
with marsupial mice.

399
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:56,650
And there was
something having to do

400
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,280
with their marsupialesque
reproduction that

401
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,770
made this the species
to do this with.

402
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,760
But it was doing sperm
insemination of females.

403
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,150
And what was done was
that they took the sperm

404
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,850
from these male marsupial
mice, after measuring

405
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,680
some secondary sexual
characteristics in them.

406
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,550
I believe that they
don't have antlers,

407
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,740
but I don't remember what
the actual thing was.

408
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,520
And what they were
able to do was

409
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,410
to now have sperm from
males of differing

410
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,340
degrees of exaggerated
secondary characteristics.

411
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,410
And what they showed
was that the males who

412
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,190
had the more dramatic secondary
characteristics-- their sperm

413
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,050
were more fertile.

414
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,030
So that was a first big vote
in this handicap principle

415
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,810
that things like
secondary appearances,

416
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,220
secondary sexual ones,
can be a marker for health

417
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,320
and/or fertility.

418
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,900
Now why should that be?

419
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,870
What you essentially are seeing
there is, it is a display.

420
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,390
It is a potlatch.

421
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,430
It is a display
of how much energy

422
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,650
you can afford to waste
and thus how much you

423
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,020
must have on board.

424
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,650
It is a marker of health
and good immunity.

425
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,250
This has been shown
in lots of studies.

426
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,190
Along the lines
of, the same sort

427
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,830
of signals that give rise to the
secondary sexual characteristic

428
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,460
are markers of immune function.

429
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,050
A well-functioning
immune system will

430
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,150
be generating some
molecule which

431
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,480
exaggerates facial coloration.

432
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,676
And that's the secondary
sexual characteristic--

433
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:38,630
that there is an explicit
link between immune function,

434
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,350
immune competence,
and these markers.

435
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,230
Interesting.

436
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,240
A study that just
came out recently,

437
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,660
looking at women from,
I believe it was,

438
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,390
about 20 different
industrialized countries.

439
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,250
And what was shown was
that, in general, women

440
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,300
have a preference
for faces of men

441
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,040
that have strong pronounced
secondary characteristics--

442
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,110
which is, big, jutting
jaw, high forehead,

443
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,160
lots of muscle stuff going on.

444
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,380
And what they showed was that
the longer the life expectancy

445
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,480
in the particular country,
the better the economy,

446
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,150
the better the quality of life,
the less women in that country

447
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,710
had a bias towards
male-looking males.

448
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,950
Which is extremely interesting.

449
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,420
What's the comparison there?

450
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,930
It was all those, like,
Scandinavian countries.

451
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,740
Thank god for the
Scandinavian countries,

452
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,370
because they always provide the
extreme of these distributions.

453
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,250
So, in those
Scandinavian countries,

454
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,920
like, there has not
been a guy who's been,

455
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,970
like, selected for a date
because of the height

456
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,710
of his forehead, in centuries.

457
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,380
Whereas what they showed was,
in a lot of other cultures--

458
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,360
which were the ones who were
most extreme on the list,

459
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,720
I am not remembering,
which is not very helpful.

460
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,900
But a very different
sort of end of things.

461
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,040
And there, much stronger
selection for what

462
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,950
are viewed as traits, as
markers of fecundity and health.

463
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,760
More evidence about this.

464
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,910
What you see is, all of this
is a signal-- all of this

465
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:14,740
is a signal, not only in terms
of who you want to mate with,

466
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,310
in terms of who you are
passing on your copies of genes

467
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,890
in cooperation with,
but also the possibility

468
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,030
that the other individual
is infectious with something

469
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,740
or other.

470
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,960
And throughout the
world of social beasts,

471
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,430
nobody likes getting sexually
transmitted diseases.

472
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,860
And a lot of what this whole
handicap principle is about,

473
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,530
a lot of this advertising about
what a great immune system you

474
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,470
have, is a way of
advertising, I do not

475
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,690
have a communicable disease.

476
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,330
All sorts of
species-- individuals

477
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,820
are extremely good at
detecting the smells

478
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,040
in the others of
parasitic infections,

479
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,300
of all sorts of
other infections,

480
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,890
and avoiding them
like the plague.

481
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,810
A common theme in lots
and lots of species.

482
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,560
Rodents, where it's been most
studied-- a remarkable ability

483
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,300
to smell out the health
of another individual.

484
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,540
And this is someone you want to
stay away from-- that they're

485
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,370
going to give you an STD.

486
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:16,280
So that's part of it, as well.

487
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,330
So, of course, what
you start getting

488
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,660
are individuals trying
to cheat at all of this.

489
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,070
And this is suddenly
the world of selection

490
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,240
to uncouple your secondary
sexual characteristics

491
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,640
from your health.

492
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,680
Is there a way to cheat?

493
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,530
Is there a way?

494
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,590
And what is seen in
some bird species is,

495
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,290
you've got some guy on
his deathbed, there.

496
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,890
And what's he doing with
his last 3 and 1/2 calories

497
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,000
worth of energy?

498
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He's expending it
on wing coloration

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,940
or whatever the secondary
characteristic thing is, there,

500
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,220
that he's got four
minutes of life left,

501
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,630
and maybe there's
one more chance

502
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,490
to pass on copies of his genes.

503
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,210
You get cheating, as well.

504
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,870
You get cases of
disproportionate shunting

505
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,280
of caloric investment
towards some of these markers

506
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,560
amid animals being sick.

507
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,660
So, of course, you have
to have counterstrategies.

508
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,840
And we have yet another
world of coevolution

509
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,040
between some sort of
exploitative strategy

510
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,170
and a counter one to
try to detect that.

511
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,070
Then you've got one problem with
this whole literature, which

512
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,020
is, there is a certain way to
frame things so that you never,

513
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,270
ever can get a
finding that disagrees

514
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,890
with your general stance.

515
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,234
OK, here's how it goes.

516
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:31,650
Here's the version
that we've just

517
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,890
heard of this handicap
principle, which

518
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,620
is, what you have to have
is your secondary sexual

519
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,710
characteristic-- the intensity
of it has to be reflective

520
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,710
of the quality of
your immune system.

521
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,220
And in lots of species,
facial coloration

522
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,630
is generated molecules
from the immune system

523
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,480
in a linear relationship, there.

524
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,570
Yes, that is a way
of advertising,

525
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,090
I've got a great immune system.

526
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,090
But get this.

527
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,630
Meanwhile, you can have
exactly the opposite case,

528
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,880
which is, you can have your
secondary sexual characteristic

529
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,120
driven by an infection
that you have.

530
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,690
And what you are presumably
communicating is, if I'm still

531
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,080
able to do this ridiculous
courtship dance,

532
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,680
despite the fact that I'm
teeming with parasites,

533
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,710
I've got the greatest
DNA going around, there.

534
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,070
Hey, how about it?

535
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,620
Where you see this
is in vultures.

536
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,811
And the mere notion that
vultures having sex,

537
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:31,310
and let alone them having sex
based on thinking some of them

538
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,310
are more attractive
than others, leaves

539
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,150
me breathless with admiration.

540
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,820
But what you see
is, in vultures--

541
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,950
I'm forgetting which
species-- sexually dimorphic--

542
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,970
the males have more
colorful faces.

543
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,330
They tend to have these orange
faces made out of carotenoids--

544
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,200
these pigment things.

545
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,430
These carotenoids.

546
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,660
So one version that
we've heard already

547
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,480
is, OK, where are the
carotenoids coming from?

548
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,540
They're produced in
the immune system.

549
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,890
And the happier your immune
system, the more carotenoids

550
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,870
you pump out.

551
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,010
That would be the first
scenario we've heard.

552
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,520
In vultures, you see
exactly the opposite.

553
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,851
Which is, where-- this is going
to go downhill really fast,

554
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:12,350
now.

555
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,470
So where do you get
carotenoids, if you

556
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,010
are a vulture in the
plains of East Africa?

557
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,360
You get them by
eating ungulate feces.

558
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,065
Which vultures are perfectly
happy to do, if it's fresh--

559
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:26,840
or even if it's not so fresh.

560
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,480
And what that will typically
contain are lots of parasites.

561
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,770
Consuming a whole lot
of ungulate feces,

562
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,820
rather than, say,
ungulate muscle,

563
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,740
increases the likelihood that
you have some sort of infection

564
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,790
that you've picked up.

565
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,620
What's the interpretation there?

566
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,140
Yet here I am, bouncing around
happily and energetically.

567
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,300
Just imagine how
great my genes are,

568
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,380
if I'm able to do that amid just
teeming with parasites, because

569
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,820
of my unlikely sort
of dietary habits.

570
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,870
So you've got it, here,
that it can go both ways.

571
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,930
Ooh, dramatic secondary
sexual characteristic

572
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,960
is a marker of a
good immune system--

573
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,540
I can fight off disease.

574
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,110
Dramatic secondary sexual
characteristic as a marker of,

575
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,020
look how well I'm
functioning, here,

576
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,590
despite teeming
with some disease.

577
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,620
You get it both ways.

578
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,220
It remains very,
very controversial--

579
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,200
for the three and a half people
who deeply care about this.

580
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,880
One additional version of that--
and the "there's no free lunch,

581
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,620
and there is no free
ungulate"-- whatever-- OK,

582
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,960
one additional version of that
are studies now showing that

583
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,530
in lions what you get is--
highly tournament species,

584
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,790
and thus a highly dramatic
set of secondary sexual

585
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,810
characteristics.

586
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,890
The manes.

587
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,470
The manes on the lion.

588
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,870
And what everybody
knows from The Lion King

589
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,380
is that they can be very
big and dramatic-looking

590
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,947
and thus make you
very attractive.

591
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:50,530
Unless you're hanging
out with hyenas.

592
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,780
But what is clear, also,
is, it comes with a price.

593
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,560
What is the most attractive
sort of male lion you can see?

594
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,470
It's a black-maned male.

595
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,090
Because that is one
that is most expensive,

596
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,420
in this
handicap-principle sense.

597
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,180
But there's a
downside, if you've

598
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,240
got a black mane, which is,
your head heats up more, sitting

599
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,820
there in the African sun.

600
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,090
You've got to spend more
energy on thermal regulation.

601
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,890
There's a downside to it.

602
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,010
All of these things,
where you're balancing.

603
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,990
What else?

604
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,690
What else, in terms
of attractiveness?

605
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,680
So we've now got,
lots of species,

606
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,830
the symmetry business
as a marker for health.

607
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,090
The secondary sexual
characteristic nonsense

608
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,170
stuff as a marker of
health but interpretable

609
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,900
in a number of different ways.

610
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,290
Then there are the secondary
sexual characteristics

611
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,970
that are more directly
markers of fertility.

612
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,840
And what we've
entered into, here,

613
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,940
is the world of primate
species, where females

614
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,890
have external swellings
when ovulating,

615
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,340
when there are visible signs
of estrus, of going into heat.

616
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,550
Humans are concealed ovulators.

617
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,940
And we already know some
of the theories about that.

618
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,560
But all the other primates get
explicit, observable estrus

619
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,300
swellings when it is time
that they're ovulating.

620
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,030
And all you need to
do is look at baboons.

621
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,110
And beginning somewhere
around junior high,

622
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,270
when they start hitting
puberty, some females

623
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,560
have bigger swellings
than other females.

624
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,270
And it turns out, these
stupid, shallow male baboons

625
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,560
prefer the ones with the
big swellings to the ones

626
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,870
with the small swellings.

627
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,590
You can even show, with
captive male baboons,

628
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,840
that they will
lever-press more to get

629
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,250
to see pictures
of female baboons

630
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,920
with big swellings instead
of middle-sized ones

631
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,840
or little ones.

632
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,580


633
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,330
There you go.

634
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,000
Somewhere out there, there
is a magnificent reality

635
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,690
show to be set up
along those lines.

636
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,900
What you see with that is,
what's the swellings about?

637
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,320
It is a marker of
estrogen levels.

638
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,660
It is a marker of-- the
higher the estrogen levels,

639
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,270
the more the swelling.

640
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,110
And what you wind up
seeing, in various studies

641
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,630
by now, replicated,
showing that,

642
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,180
among female nonhuman
primates, those females

643
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,090
with larger swellings have
a better infant survival

644
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,140
during the first year
of life of the kids.

645
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,580
It's a marker of greater
fertility and greater health.

646
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,640
And there's maybe some element
of a handicap principle

647
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,690
there, because by the time
you get female monkeys

648
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,170
with the biggest
swellings around, they now

649
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,780
weigh about 25% more than they
weigh the rest of the time,

650
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,030
all because of the
water retention.

651
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,630
And presumably
part of the signal

652
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,090
there is, if I can
be running around

653
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,070
in my female-in-estrus
sort of way,

654
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,440
despite 25% more weight sloshing
around at the end of me, just

655
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,790
imagine how strong
and healthy I am.

656
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,920
So that, as a source
of attraction.

657
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,530
Meanwhile, over at the
male end of things,

658
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,280
in terms of looking for
other markers of attraction

659
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,620
in females-- by the
time you get to humans,

660
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,240
we are not, again,
external ovulators.

661
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,310
But what you have with humans
is the famed waist-hip ratio

662
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,060
measure.

663
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,860
And this one has been endlessly
studied and argued about.

664
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,970
The notion that the larger
the size of the hips,

665
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,660
relative to the size of
the waist, the greater

666
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,850
the waist-hip ratio--
no, the lesser

667
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,110
the-- flip that
around the other way.

668
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,650
OK.

669
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,300
The bigger the hips are,
relative to the waist--

670
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,630
this is a marker of fertility.

671
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,970
That is a marker of
childbearing pelvises.

672
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,850
That is a marker of all
sorts of developmental health

673
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,200
that augurs well for having
a baby pass through the birth

674
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,870
canal.

675
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,990
In culture after
culture, men find

676
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,910
women to be more attractive
who have a higher-skewed ratio

677
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,260
of hip to waist.

678
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,130
So that's been studied
all over the place.

679
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,100
What you have, though, as
the central controversy

680
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,230
in that field is, if every
single culture that that's

681
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,140
been studied in has been
contaminated by their exposure

682
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,550
to westernized culture
and its pervasive values,

683
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,180
which may be the source of that.

684
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,270
So, among the hip-waist
sort of zealots,

685
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:15,150
what has been the Golden
Fleece to go after,

686
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,440
what has been the
equivalent of getting

687
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,700
identical twins separated at
birth, what is the thing they

688
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,900
go after, is to find
a population of humans

689
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,070
who are having their first
contact with the outside world

690
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,360
and have had no exposure
to the westernized world.

691
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,880
And thus you are able
to rush in there,

692
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,970
quickly master their
language, and, once you've

693
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,280
done that, you get to ask
them the first question

694
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,430
in their entire content with
the westernized world, which

695
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,670
is, so, which of these
look better to you?

696
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,140
Asking the guys, there.

697
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,100
And, at this point--
not surprisingly,

698
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,550
there is not a huge
literature of asking people,

699
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,990
on the first encounters, about
hip-waist ratios-- what you see

700
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,380
is, the literature is mixed.

701
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,080
When you look at more
traditional societies,

702
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,980
you do not necessarily
see as strong

703
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,200
of a hip-waist-ratio
set of opinions.

704
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,260
But nonetheless, at
least some of that

705
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,120
is universal in every culture
that's been looked at.

706
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,610
Again, as a marker of fertility.

707
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,097
Meanwhile, over at the
female end of things,

708
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:17,930
you've already heard
what some of the things

709
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,050
are that are looked for,
in terms of responsiveness

710
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,260
to secondary
characteristics in males,

711
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,550
which is jutting jaws, big,
high foreheads, and muscle mass.

712
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,660
And all of these are
assays indirectly

713
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,990
of testosterone
levels or testosterone

714
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,270
exposure or sensitivity
during adolescence.

715
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,530
Those are preferred.

716
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,940
Interesting thing.

717
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,920
Studies showing that,
when you give women

718
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,970
a choice of faces of males
that have been manipulated,

719
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,120
changing the
dramatic-- how dramatic

720
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,810
the secondary characteristics
are-- like forehead

721
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,910
and jutting-jawedness and
angularity of face and stuff--

722
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,540
what you see is an
interesting dichotomy.

723
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,240
Which is, in these studies,
women on the average rate

724
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,990
the rounder-faced
pictures of men, such men,

725
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,830
looking more likable, more
honest, more trustworthy,

726
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,969
and less desirable.

727
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:16,739
OK.

728
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,300
So this is hopeless.

729
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,239
And what do you know?

730
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,590
Those-- well, I won't
go there, either.

731
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,600
What those show is
separable traits, there.

732
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,400
Separable traits,
in terms of what's

733
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,800
attractive-- what information.

734
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,219
And, again, when you
look at these studies,

735
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,915
the differences are, like, 5%
difference in nostril width

736
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:41,179
and things, when they're manip--
these are extraordinarily

737
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,639
subtle differences, where
people are not consciously aware

738
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,159
of them.

739
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,690
Which face looks
more attractive?

740
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,850
Which face would you like more?

741
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,590
Which face would you trust
more if they told you

742
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,440
to vote for somebody or other?

743
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,150
An interesting
separation, there.

744
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,850
OK.

745
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,250
One additional one
is that, in women,

746
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,010
when women are
ovulating, they prefer

747
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,770
more sexually secondary,
secondary-sexually

748
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:11,430
characteristically
dramatic male faces.

749
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,710
At the time of ovulation, women
rate as more attractive male

750
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,990
faces with the juttier jaws
and the greater muscle mass

751
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,020
and the forehead stuff going on.

752
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,930
What we see here is this theme
of, at the time that estrogen

753
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,090
levels are at their highest
in humans and lots of realms,

754
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,770
in addition to other
species, detection

755
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,850
of pheromones from males
is the most sensitive.

756
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,030
Ability to pick up
subtle differences

757
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,180
in facial symmetry or secondary
sexual characteristics

758
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,120
are at their best.

759
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,320
And the preferences
are derived from that.

760
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,140
This is, in some cases, some
rather substantial effects.

761
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,920
OK.

762
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,550
So, what other things?

763
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,761
There's one problem that runs
through this entire literature.

764
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:57,260
OK.

765
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,880
So here's the deal.

766
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,380
You are a-- uh--
you're a gazelle.

767
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,685
You're a female gazelle, and
you have read lots of zoology

768
00:36:06,685 --> 00:36:08,775
and you know all about
this handicap principle.

769
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:12,170
And you know the fact that
big, dramatic secondary sexual

770
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,640
characteristics on
guys is a marker

771
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,440
of better immune systems
and more fertile sperm

772
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,930
and all sorts of great stuff.

773
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,270
So you go out of your way to
go and find one of those guys.

774
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,620
You mate with him.

775
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,090
And you've just given birth.

776
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,290
So, knowing what you know, what
you, of course, now realize

777
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,060
is, you've got a great
kid on your hands

778
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,830
that have all these
terrific genes

779
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,640
from that jutting-jawed
antelope guy you mated with.

780
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,010
And you better make
sure this kid survives,

781
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,570
because they have an
enormous potential

782
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,470
for having a big reproductive
success later on.

783
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,860
What do you do?

784
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,360
You expend more calories
in taking care of them.

785
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,180
This has been shown in
all sorts of species.

786
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,680
Mate various birds in various
bird species-- mate females

787
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,070
with males who are more
attractive versus mating them

788
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,300
with less attractive,
and what you see

789
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,720
is that the females
who have mated

790
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,270
with the more attractive males
give birth to bigger eggs.

791
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,620
That's interesting.

792
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,270
OK, so you're seeing the
evidence of the good genes

793
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,550
coming from the guy.

794
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,610
Male genes have nothing
to do with egg size.

795
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,410
It is how much
protein the mother

796
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,690
puts into the egg production
and the egg development.

797
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,430
And what you see is, she
makes this a self-fulfilling

798
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,400
prophecy.

799
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,510
In a lot of species,
now, it has been

800
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,070
shown that when females mate
with more attractive males

801
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,280
they put more effort into
having the offspring survive.

802
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,860
The offspring survive better.

803
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,520
And yes, what do you know?

804
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,010
You really do want to mate
with guys with big antlers

805
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,120
and that sort of thing.

806
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,000
This big problem with
self-fulfilling stuff.

807
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,070
So that's a confound that
has run through the field.

808
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,230
Another confound--
and here is one

809
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,100
that shows how many species
are far less distant from us

810
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,180
than one might think.

811
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,670
This was work by a
guy named Lee Dugatkin

812
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,160
at the University of Kentucky.

813
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,750
And what he does is study
ospreys or some kind

814
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,750
of bird thing that runs around.

815
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:19,440
And what he does is, he first
gets a male and female osprey,

816
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,230
and he introduces
them to each other.

817
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,360
And what he looks
for are circumstances

818
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,390
where the magic does not occur.

819
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,080
There is no chemistry
between them.

820
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,090
The female rejects the guy.

821
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,880
And, at that point, what he
does is, in the next round,

822
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,560
he makes the male appear
to be very popular.

823
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,300
He puts the male here,
and he takes a whole bunch

824
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,400
of stuffed female birds
and puts them around

825
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,740
in a circle around him, gawking
at him with rapt admiration

826
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,625
and just frozen in their
place at the wonders of, like,

827
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:54,110
the coloration on his bill from
eating who-knows-whose feces.

828
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,710
And what you see
then is, the female

829
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,190
who spurned him is
now more likely to do

830
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,195
solicitive courting
gestures with him.

831
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:06,960
In other words, she's
jumping on a bandwagon.

832
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,510
And this has now been shown
in a number of species.

833
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,185
What's the logic of this?

834
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:14,090
This is exactly what secondary
sexual characteristics

835
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,930
are about.

836
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,270
I don't understand
why anyone considers

837
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,550
that to be attractive.

838
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,740
This individual
does nothing for me.

839
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,820
But if it appears to be the
case that those traits are very

840
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,990
popular, and thus those
traits are predictors

841
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,470
of being able to pass on
many copies of your genes,

842
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,960
I sure want my kids
to have those traits.

843
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,060
And thus this bandwagon effect.

844
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,180
So all of these are
versions of just shallow,

845
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,470
shallow,
horrible-values versions

846
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,000
of who one looks for in a mate.

847
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,110
But then, of course, we go to
all the pair-bonding species.

848
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,350
And as we heard from
many lectures ago,

849
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,720
the rituals in lots of those
species of male courtship

850
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,740
built around showing that
they are a competent parent.

851
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,100
Showing that they can do some
rough approximation of acting

852
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,800
like a mother to these babies.

853
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,890
What's that about?

854
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:05,490
And that's the whole world
of male birds doing courtship

855
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:09,350
by bringing worms and feeding
the mother and showing, look,

856
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,970
I know what kind
of things we eat.

857
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,480
I know how to bring a worm.

858
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,010
By the time you get to
pair-bonding species,

859
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,160
the rituals and what is
attractive are often markers

860
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,190
not of fertility but of
parenting skill-- parenting

861
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,490
competence.

862
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,590
Flipped the other way, in
most nonhuman primate species

863
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,850
that have been looked
at, when are females

864
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,070
most attractive to males,
independent of the size

865
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,450
of their estrus swelling?

866
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,170
When they've already
had a couple of kids.

867
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,540
Females, the first-time-out
rounds of ovulating,

868
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,480
are less preferred
than females who have

869
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,070
had a number of kids already.

870
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,930
If it is the same thing going
on, what she has already proven

871
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,140
is she's competent
enough that she didn't

872
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,880
kill the kids by
dropping them out

873
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,530
of the tree at various points.

874
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:59,110
This being as a marker,
again, of competence.

875
00:40:59,110 --> 00:40:59,880
OK.

876
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,120
Final realm of what one
looks for in a mate,

877
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,370
across lots and lots
of different species.

878
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,910
Which is not only
someone who appears

879
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,690
healthy and symmetrical,
and these exciting secondary

880
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,210
characteristics that are
markers of lots of fertility,

881
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,990
and also whatever everybody
else thinks is attractive,

882
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,450
you suddenly do as well--
the last thing that

883
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,250
tends to be a theme through
lots and lots of species,

884
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,270
and in every human
culture, is being

885
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:29,350
attracted to someone who's
kind of just like you are.

886
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,990
Being attracted to
someone who is similar.

887
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,250
And the term for
this is "homogamy."

888
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,050
Homogamy, polygamy, monogamy.

889
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,330
In this case, homogamy--
mating with someone

890
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:47,770
who is homogeneous, who is
similar in traits of yours.

891
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:51,510
And across cultures, including
in the United States,

892
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:56,590
people are extremely homogamous
in who they wind up marrying.

893
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,250
Here are the statistics.

894
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,770
When you look at
couples in this country,

895
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,850
there is better than a
90%-chance likelihood of them

896
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,980
sharing the same religion, of
being within three years of age

897
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,420
of each other, of sharing the
same race-- the ethnicity--

898
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,220
sharing the socioeconomic
status of their childhood--

899
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,400
did they both grow up
poor, wealthy, whatever--

900
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
and sharing political views.

901
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,610
More than 90% concordance
in this country

902
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,440
on those traits-- markers
of homogamous preference

903
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,330
for someone who
is just like you.

904
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:35,820
Stepping down a bit-- not in
this range-- but more than 40%

905
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,730
homogamy for a couple
having IQs that are within,

906
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,150
I don't know, five points
of each other-- having

907
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,400
similar levels of education.

908
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,820
Those are very
homogamous traits.

909
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,000
Then a whole bunch
of weirdo minor ones

910
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,360
which, nonetheless, are still
statistically significant.

911
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,470
A 20% to 40%
likelihood of couples

912
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,940
being the same height--
not the same height,

913
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,195
but say, for example,
in the top 10

914
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:05,090
percentile of height
for their sex-- scaled

915
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,670
to what's within gender.

916
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,530
Weight, hair color.

917
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:13,560
And then you get into this
bizarre world of lung capacity,

918
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,200
of width of nostrils,
of width of eyes.

919
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,180
People have studied these,
and these are traits

920
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,450
that show significant homogamy.

921
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,790
In this fairly low range,
but nonetheless significant

922
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,430
at a higher-than-expected rate.

923
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,230
What are these weird
things being about?

924
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,110
These are probably
surrogate markers

925
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,070
for preferring people of
similar race, similar ethnicity.

926
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,210
That's probably where those
numbers are coming from.

927
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,960
So what's this about?

928
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,100
This is suddenly barreling
us back into the world

929
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,680
from many lectures
ago of, you don't

930
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,560
want to mate with
someone who shares

931
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,780
half their genes with you--
the dangers of inbreeding.

932
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,910
But you also don't
necessarily want

933
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,400
to mate with someone who
is so unrelated that there

934
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,540
is no drive of kin
selection for cooperation.

935
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,340
We have now heard, from
bird species to humans,

936
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,580
you get the optimal
fertility somewhere

937
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,830
around third to fourth cousins.

938
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,280
You get the optimal
fertility, under circumstances

939
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,120
that select for a fair
degree of homogamy

940
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,120
across different cultures.

941
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,930
And historically, this
is no surprise at all--

942
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,930
that there is a great
deal of homogamy.

943
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,170
Various studies have shown
that your average traditional

944
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,360
hunter-gatherer winds
up being married

945
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,450
to somebody who grew up
less than 40 kilometers away

946
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,630
from them.

947
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,510
Studies show that people
in traditional agricultural

948
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,750
villages in the
developing world wind up

949
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,520
being married to someone,
on the average, less than 10

950
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,320
kilometers away from them.

951
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,890
You are getting an awful
lot of people winding up

952
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,220
being married with individuals
who look a lot like them.

953
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,300
And back to that issue
of partial relatedness--

954
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,590
third to fourth cousins.

955
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,516
Yes.

956
00:44:55,516 --> 00:44:58,550
But couldn't it just be that
I know a lot more people who

957
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:01,035
are the same age as
me, the same race,

958
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:04,020
the same socioeconomic
status, and so on?

959
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,430
OK, well, though,
look around the room.

960
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,330
This is a very
heterogeneous corner

961
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,440
of the planet we've
come up with, here.

962
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,010
Yes, it's very
different when you

963
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,460
look in more homogeneous
societies, there.

964
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,460
But when you begin to look
at the increasingly diverse

965
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,060
Western European ones,
you see a fair amount

966
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,580
of homogamy going on.

967
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,580
Very interesting data.

968
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,740
Iceland-- yet another of
our good-old Scandinavian--

969
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,680
is Iceland technically
Scandinavian?

970
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,470
Or are they just,
like, good guys

971
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:34,960
who should be Scandinavians?

972
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,801
They're so dull and
healthy and sensible.

973
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:39,300
OK.

974
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,660
So in those sensible,
non-Scandinavian Icelandics,

975
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,350
who have, like-- I
don't know, what?

976
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,000
--300,000 people in the whole
country, and all of them

977
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,540
are no more than sixth
cousins apart, and all of them

978
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,520
have just fanatically clean
records, going back centuries,

979
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,700
as to who was married
to who, studies

980
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,280
have now been done, looking
over the course of 200 years,

981
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,040
in Iceland of how closely
related different couples were.

982
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,360
And what you see is, optimal
fertility, optimal number

983
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,640
of children who
survived into adulthood,

984
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,130
you get from third- to
fourth-cousin marriages.

985
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,990
Recent studies showing that.

986
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,200
One additional,
interesting version

987
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,550
of this homogamy stuff, which
is, in the United States

988
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,710
you see something
slightly different.

989
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,310
You see an age factor
coming in here,

990
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:37,040
which is, people are more likely
to make less homogamous choices

991
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,010
as to their mates, the younger
they are when they get married.

992
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,070
What's that a surrogate for?

993
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,110
The incredibly depressing
fact that, on the average,

994
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,290
people get more and
more closed-minded

995
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,560
as they get older.

996
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,330
You see the greatest
heterogamy in marriages--

997
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,480
the greatest likelihood
of people marrying someone

998
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,330
with a very different
background, the younger they

999
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:00,830
are.

1000
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,460
In the early 20s is
when you find the peak

1001
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,590
for a lot of these traits-- when
you find the least homogamy.

1002
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:11,400
One interesting exception to
that, or a partial exception,

1003
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,970
which is with religion.

1004
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,200
And what you see is, you
look at people getting

1005
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,890
married in their early 20s.

1006
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:20,850
This is the likelihood
of marrying somebody

1007
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,250
from a different religion.

1008
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,030
And then it goes way
down in the 30s and 40s.

1009
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,210
And somewhere between
50 and 60, there's

1010
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,060
another little
blip that goes up.

1011
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,960
And this has been documented
in a number of studies.

1012
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,680
What's that blip about?

1013
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,910
Any theories?

1014
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,606
Oh-- OK, somebody
[INAUDIBLE] there.

1015
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:45,100
Um-- fewer options for mates?

1016
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,900
Fewer options for mates.

1017
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,380
That's one depressing
possibility.

1018
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,550
And just wait until you're in
the nursing home and, like,

1019
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,460
anything that moves
you imprint on.

1020
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,965
Yes, theory?

1021
00:47:56,965 --> 00:47:58,590
They're not going to
have kids anymore,

1022
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,510
so they don't need to
worry about passing down

1023
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,593
[INAUDIBLE] to their kids.

1024
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:02,200
OK.

1025
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,370
So the issue of-- if you
do that, if you have waited

1026
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,870
long enough that you're not
going to have kids, that you're

1027
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,810
not going to have
all these fights of,

1028
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:15,020
are you going to be a, you know,
a Mac family or a PC family

1029
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,670
or all those sorts of things
that can tear people apart

1030
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,370
[INAUDIBLE].

1031
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,624
OK, so that's a possibility.

1032
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:20,540
How about another one?

1033
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,040
Yeah.

1034
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,020
You're reflecting
your mortality.

1035
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,130
OK, you're reflecting
on mortality,

1036
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,850
and you're deciding,
enough of that nonsense.

1037
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:29,840
Who cares?

1038
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,580
This is someone who matters.

1039
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,920
Yes, that's a possibility.

1040
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,690
What else?

1041
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,410
Was that an idea?

1042
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,810
Midlife crisis?

1043
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,200
Midlife crisis.

1044
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,020
So it's either you
get a convertible

1045
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:44,190
or you marry someone
from, you know,

1046
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,260
Tierra Del Fuego or something.

1047
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,260
So all of those
seem to go into it.

1048
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,550
One additional one, which
I find to be absolutely,

1049
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,990
like, wonderful, in terms
of just how bizarre it is.

1050
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:57,190
Which is, when they
interview people,

1051
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,910
what you also see is, the ones
who tend to have this peak,

1052
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,140
they have been in
long-term relationships

1053
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,090
with the individual.

1054
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,540
What was that about?

1055
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,240
They're waiting for
their parents to die,

1056
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,653
so they don't kill them
by marrying this person.

1057
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:12,380
[LAUGHTER]

1058
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,160
That appears to be
part of that scenario.

1059
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,160
Which is, once they're dead,
then we can go get married.

1060
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,960
Because I couldn't possibly
do this to them before then.

1061
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,950
And that appears to be
part of this peak, also.

1062
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:26,500
OK.

1063
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,350
Finally-- finally, a
study-- famous study

1064
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:32,150
that was done
about 15 years ago,

1065
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,340
by an evolutionary biologist
named David Buss, who's

1066
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,190
now at the University of Texas.

1067
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,190
He wasn't, at the time.

1068
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,330
And he did one of
these sorts of studies

1069
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:45,660
that we recognize by now, which
is sort of questioning people,

1070
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,530
questionnaires of people from
a lot of different cultures,

1071
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,170
all over the planet.

1072
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,589
And this was this massive study
of I don't remember how many

1073
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:56,380
different cultures.

1074
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,800
But it ranged from
non-westernized, nomadic

1075
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,890
pastoralists, non-westernized
agriculturalists,

1076
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:07,050
socialist countries, communist
ones, capitalist ones--

1077
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,450
everything in between--
individualistic societies,

1078
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,500
communalist societies--
all of that.

1079
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,180
It was tens of thousands
of people in the study.

1080
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,710
Where he gave all these
people a list of traits.

1081
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,090
And he would say,
which of these traits

1082
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,640
are most important to you,
in terms of who you marry?

1083
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,540
And what came out in
every single culture

1084
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,230
looked at-- as follows.

1085
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,370
In every culture
looked at, women

1086
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:39,570
are more likely than men to want
a mate who is older than them.

1087
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,880
In every culture looked at,
men, more common than women,

1088
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,780
looking for someone
who's younger than them.

1089
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:52,440
In every culture looked
at, women more than men

1090
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,310
citing the economic
prowess of this individual

1091
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,410
as being part of
what constitutes

1092
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,720
the desirable traits.

1093
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,580
In every one of them
that's been looked at,

1094
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,830
men having a greater preference
than women for markers-- health

1095
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:13,160
markers-- of fertility in the
person they would wind up with.

1096
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,250
This was so depressing,
because this

1097
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,500
is every culture on this planet
coming up with this cliche.

1098
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,790
Everybody learned
about the study,

1099
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,780
and how remarkably
disturbing it was

1100
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,390
in terms of all of those
stereotypes across so

1101
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,820
many different cultures.

1102
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,490
Women are looking for older
guys who have lots of money,

1103
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,300
and men are looking for
younger women with big hips

1104
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,390
or who knows what.

1105
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:40,470
And this came through
in every single culture.

1106
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,710
But what everybody
always misses when

1107
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,900
they discuss this study
was one additional one.

1108
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,400
And this is, like,
enough for, like,

1109
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,450
Hallmark cards-- all of that.

1110
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,280
What everybody knows is,
across these cultures,

1111
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,750
these traits were more
likely to be rated

1112
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,240
highly by one sex
versus the other,

1113
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,620
but in every single one of
the countries, what you find

1114
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,100
is both sexes had an equal
preference for the number

1115
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,270
one thing on the list, which
is winding up with somebody

1116
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,670
who's nice to them.

1117
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,180
OK.

1118
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,100
On that note,
let's take a break.

1119
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,730
We now switch to
our next second half

1120
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:20,110
of the course topic,
which is going to follow

1121
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,044
the exact same strategy.

1122
00:52:22,044 --> 00:52:23,460
And where we're
shifting to, here,

1123
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,780
is going to be a whole bunch
of lectures on the large,

1124
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,030
sprawling,
interconnected subjects

1125
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:34,470
of aggression, violence,
competition, cooperation,

1126
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,450
empathy.

1127
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,080
And what we will be
doing there is wrestling

1128
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,440
with all sorts of features
of the complexities of these

1129
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,690
and where the
underlying biology is--

1130
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:48,180
enormously important
social implications,

1131
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,780
in a lot of these cases.

1132
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,000
And, of course, what we
need to start off with

1133
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,410
is, what's the behavior about?

1134
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,980
How objectively do you
describe these things?

1135
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,160
And it struck me-- a good way of
starting that, not only giving

1136
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,540
a sense of the range of
what aggression can be like,

1137
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,210
but also a very important point
that's going to come through

1138
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,700
in this entire lecture-- it
struck me that a good thing

1139
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,760
to be would be to describe a
relatively recent exposure I

1140
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,370
had to human aggression.

1141
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,860
Which was me being
aggressive to somebody else.

1142
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,890
This was, now, a
couple of years ago,

1143
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,730
before my back
disintegrated on me.

1144
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,320
I used to play soccer
two, three times a week.

1145
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,050
And I had been doing
this for decades.

1146
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,070
And I'm actually
totally lousy at soccer.

1147
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,560
And, like, I'm short
and I'm old and I'm not

1148
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,890
particularly coordinated.

1149
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,800
And [INAUDIBLE].

1150
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,300
So this has never
been something that

1151
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,330
was, like, one of the things I
was going to go to the Olympics

1152
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:44,880
with.

1153
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,870
So, a number of years ago,
there was consistently

1154
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,690
this one guy who seemed
to always wind up

1155
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,380
on the other side, and who
somehow always wound up

1156
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,040
guarding me, who was a
total son of a bitch.

1157
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,710
This guy, he was-- he was
a lot younger than me,

1158
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:02,330
and he was a lot more athletic,
and he was a lot taller

1159
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,660
than me, and he was a lot
more skillful in this game.

1160
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,150
And, on top of everything else,
he was a really dirty player.

1161
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,737
And this was driving me crazy.

1162
00:54:09,737 --> 00:54:11,320
Every time the ball
would get near me,

1163
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,050
he would elbow me in my ear,
and he would do something like--

1164
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:14,550
[LAUGHTER]

1165
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,133
--that he wasn't
supposed to be doing.

1166
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:16,870
That sort.

1167
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:20,100
And one day, we
were out playing,

1168
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,900
and somebody passed
the ball to me.

1169
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,840
And, as per usual,
he effortlessly

1170
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,030
knocked me out of the way--
crudely and illegally,

1171
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,600
which no one seemed to notice--
and then stole the ball.

1172
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,100
And I was pissed.

1173
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,960
And this guy quickly
passed it to someone else.

1174
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,270
And the two of us
were sort of running

1175
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,750
towards a corner of the field.

1176
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,870
And momentum was carrying us.

1177
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,210
And I sort of realized
that the ball was now

1178
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:49,630
kind of elsewhere in the field,
and thus everybody's attention

1179
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,840
was kind of elsewhere
in the field.

1180
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,480
So we're running along, and I'm,
like, a half step behind him,

1181
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,040
and I just stick my foot
in front of his ankle

1182
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,494
and send him rolling and--

1183
00:54:58,494 --> 00:54:59,910
[LAUGHTER AND SCATTERED
 APPLAUSE]

1184
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,190
--sprawling, and this
was the best-- heaven.

1185
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,590
This was during the summer.

1186
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,780
And it turned out there
was a mud hole there.

1187
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,910
It hadn't rained in six months.

1188
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,550
This was wonderful!

1189
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,880
So he goes-- and I didn't even
go through the pretense of, oh,

1190
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,660
are you OK?

1191
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,540
Sorry about that.

1192
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,015
It was just-- yeah!

1193
00:55:17,015 --> 00:55:18,990
[LAUGHTER]

1194
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,870
I had to restrain
myself from ripping

1195
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:24,790
his stomach open with my
canines, at that point.

1196
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,797
So I felt wonderful!

1197
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:28,255
This was, like,
the best thing that

1198
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,620
had happened to me in months.

1199
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,680
[LAUGHTER]

1200
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,570
Nelson Mandela.

1201
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,950
[LAUGHTER]

1202
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,360
Nelson Mandela.

1203
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,750
Now in his 92nd
year, frail-- frail.

1204
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:45,380
An icon of all that is good
and wonderful about humans.

1205
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,470
This man on his last legs, now.

1206
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,700
What if I had been playing
soccer with Nelson Mandela

1207
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,500
and I did that to him?

1208
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,470
You'd be horrified!

1209
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,890
Nobody would be on the edge of
applauding that sort of thing.

1210
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:00,120
This would be
unspeakable, if I had

1211
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,880
done that to delightful
Nelson Mandela at age 92.

1212
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,230
So what we see here is
a very important thing

1213
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,860
that is going to run
through all of this topic.

1214
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:14,550
Which is, very little about
the social, the environmental,

1215
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,450
the learning aspects
of aggression

1216
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,080
have to do with learning
how to be aggressive.

1217
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,130
It's all about when.

1218
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,250
It's all about the appropriate
social context for it.

1219
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,340
Because that speaks
to something that

1220
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,850
is absolutely clear
for 99.9% of us.

1221
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,610
We do not want a world
without violence.

1222
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,760
We love violence.

1223
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,530
We get excited by it.

1224
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,550
We will pay good money
to see the right displays

1225
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:43,990
of competitive violence.

1226
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,130
We will barely
restrain ourselves

1227
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,750
from leaping in and joining it.

1228
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,190
It is all so wonderful
and exciting.

1229
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:53,660
We love violence-- when
it's the right kind.

1230
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,000
When it's in the right context.

1231
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,160
And a huge percentage
of wrestling

1232
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,390
with this is built around the
fact that, in some settings,

1233
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:06,010
the exact same behavior gets
you medals, gets you promotions,

1234
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,620
gets you differential
reproductive success.

1235
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,210
And the exact same patterns of
what you do with your muscles

1236
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:15,250
in another setting is some
of the worst things you could

1237
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,840
do as a human to another human.

1238
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,850
And it's the same behavior.

1239
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,010
And what we're going to
be wrestling with, over

1240
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,880
and over and over, in the
subject, as we march back,

1241
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,770
here, is this whole issue of,
very little about the biology

1242
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,900
of violence,
competition, all of that,

1243
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,620
is about how to
do the behaviors.

1244
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,560
It is all about
appropriate context.

1245
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,340
And what we will
see is, all sorts

1246
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,950
of realms of neurological
diseases, where things

1247
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:46,820
go majorly wrong, in terms
of control against violence--

1248
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:50,570
very rarely will it be that it's
the magnitude of violence which

1249
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,300
is wrong.

1250
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,920
What you see is, it's
in the wrong context.

1251
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,500
Because if it's done
right we love it,

1252
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,870
and we elect people who
have been good at it,

1253
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:02,280
and we differentially mate with
them, and we pay to see it.

1254
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,270
It's got to be in
the right setting.

1255
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:07,510
There are very few of us who
viscerally are truly, truly

1256
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,100
pacifists, all across the board.

1257
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,570
We just don't like violence
in certain settings.

1258
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,240
So that will be part
of the challenge,

1259
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,930
here-- making sense of the
biology of social context.

1260
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,410
And we've already
gotten some hints

1261
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,140
about that in the last topic.

1262
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,270
So, of course, what we
have to start off with

1263
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,450
is, like, definitions.

1264
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,250
And it's never
more in this realm

1265
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,320
that you get the "I don't
know how to define it,

1266
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,820
but I know it when
I see it" sort

1267
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,930
of notion in dealing with terms
for aggression and violence.

1268
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,190
Probably a great
starting point is,

1269
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,860
just as with the
sexual-behavior subject,

1270
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,600
starting off with,
well, what aspects

1271
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,520
of violence and aggression
are unique to humans?

1272
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,210
And what the theme has been
there, for decades now,

1273
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,580
is all sorts of domains that
used to be thought to be

1274
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,400
unique to humans no longer are.

1275
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,220
We've already heard
some of these examples,

1276
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,940
way back in the
sociobiology lectures--

1277
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,230
all of those wildlife films
where, somewhere in there,

1278
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:09,190
somebody with a very deep voice
has to intone about how "only

1279
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,090
man kills for pleasure"-- while
watching some beasts throwing

1280
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,950
the old wildebeest
into the river, there,

1281
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,290
and misinterpreting it.

1282
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,350
And that was always
the theme-- we're

1283
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,590
the only species that kills.

1284
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,300
And that went down the
tubes, way back when,

1285
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:27,720
as soon as people started
seeing competitive infanticide.

1286
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,700
That was first seen--
again, I think I

1287
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,760
mentioned-- in langur monkeys.

1288
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,015
A primatologist
named Sara Hrdy, who

1289
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,760
was at Harvard at
the time-- and she

1290
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,230
was the first to report this.

1291
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,440
And-- this could not be!

1292
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,940
That male langur monkeys
were killing babies?

1293
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,010
This was impossible.

1294
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:48,220
And the interpretation was that
this was a psychopathology.

1295
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,850
This was because of increasing
habitat degradation,

1296
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:55,480
human populations getting
closer, crowding them in.

1297
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,220
These were populations
of langur monkeys

1298
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,170
in some urban areas in India,
where she was studying them.

1299
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:05,800
This is not normal, because
no other species kills.

1300
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,350
And now that it's up to
20, 25 different species

1301
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,010
or so that does
competitive infanticide,

1302
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,420
it is quite clear we are not
the only species that kills.

1303
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,070
And we are not the
only species that

1304
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:21,120
kills in some premeditated,
strategic, Machiavellian,

1305
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,520
good for numbers of copies
of our genes kind of way.

1306
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,770
We are not the only
ones-- Jane Goodall

1307
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,850
by now having documented lots
and lots of cases of murder

1308
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:35,470
between chimps, females
killing each other's babies,

1309
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,410
males killing other
males quite frequently.

1310
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,630
And, once again, we are
not the only species.

1311
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,980
What's also become clear
from more recent work

1312
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,550
with chimpanzees is,
we're not the only species

1313
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,320
that makes weapons.

1314
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,170
Chimps have now been observed
to take large, heavy branches

1315
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,250
and break off the
ancillary branches,

1316
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,820
there, and smooth it out
and use it as a weapon,

1317
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,750
to try to hit another animal.

1318
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,630
This is tool use
and tool production.

1319
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,500
This is another species
making a weapon.

1320
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,900
We are also not the only species
that has organized violence.

1321
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,200
And this is back,
again, to chimps.

1322
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,490
Something mentioned way
back when in the lectures--

1323
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:18,740
the facts that chimps
are female-exogamous,

1324
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,650
that business that,
at puberty, it's

1325
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:23,930
the females who pick up and
move to a different group.

1326
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,910
All of the adult
males in a chimp group

1327
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,700
are relatively
related to each other.

1328
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,230
They are relatives.

1329
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:35,120
And what you get, then,
is cooperative aggression

1330
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,800
among males from a
particular group.

1331
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,900
What you will see
is border patrols.

1332
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,290
Goodall was the first to use
this term to describe it.

1333
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,000
You will get-- the
males of the group

1334
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,960
will get into an
extremely agitated state

1335
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,680
with each other-- a state
of emotional contagion,

1336
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,940
where they build up this very
high level of excitation.

1337
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:02,300
And they then go and patrol the
territory between their group

1338
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,130
and the next group over.

1339
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,910
And what Goodall was the
first to document was,

1340
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:09,500
if they encounter a male
from the other group,

1341
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,160
they will kill him.

1342
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:16,250
And what she also documented was
cases of groups of male chimps

1343
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:20,560
systematically killing all of
the males of the neighboring

1344
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,610
group.

1345
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,740
What is it that we've just
seen, now, in another species?

1346
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,970
Genocide-- the notion of killing
an individual not because

1347
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:33,240
of who they are but because of
what group, what population,

1348
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,670
they belong to, as
part of a desire

1349
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,760
to eradicate a
population as a whole.

1350
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,240
We are not the only
species that has

1351
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,920
something resembling genocide,
if it's termed that way.

1352
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,940
So where is a domain
where we might be unique?

1353
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,450
Lots of people still
argue that humans

1354
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:55,940
are the only species that
psychopathologically confuse

1355
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,960
sexual behavior with aggressive
behavior-- world of sadism

1356
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,750
and masochism and all of that.

1357
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,930
That appears to be
something resembling

1358
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,920
a human-unique trait.

1359
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,560
OK.

1360
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,460
Now flipping to the more
cheerful side of things--

1361
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,730
the cooperation,
the empathy stuff--

1362
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:16,760
what aspects of those
behaviors are unique to humans?

1363
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,220
And what people
used to think was

1364
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,096
an exclusively human
ability-- yeah?

1365
01:03:21,096 --> 01:03:25,082
Are there any instances where
certain troops of monkeys

1366
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:27,526
will not only just kill all
the males in a different troop

1367
01:03:27,526 --> 01:03:29,986
but kill all females
and infants, too,

1368
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:31,960
as in [INAUDIBLE] genocide?

1369
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,490
Yeah.

1370
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,420
They will kill the infants,
out of competitive infanticide

1371
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,050
stuff.

1372
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:40,020
And they will then happily
hang with the females.

1373
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,640
And do more than
that, with any luck.

1374
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,290
In terms of-- oh, a very
familiar historical strategy

1375
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:51,100
with humans, seen
again and again.

1376
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,400
Good end of things.

1377
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,330
Used to be the rule
that the humans were

1378
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,030
the only species that
showed reconciliation-- that

1379
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:02,270
showed increased likelihood
of affiliative behavior

1380
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,040
between two individuals
after they have

1381
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,520
had an aggressive interaction.

1382
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,390
In the aftermath of
it, increased odds

1383
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:15,060
of doing something affiliative--
making up-- reconciling.

1384
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,960
Doing something
along those lines.

1385
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,390
And what has emerged
in the last 20 years

1386
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:24,090
or so is a huge literature
showing reconciliative behavior

1387
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,460
in a couple of
dozen other species.

1388
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,755
First person to report
this-- primatologist Frans de

1389
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:33,550
Waal, first reporting this
in rhesus monkeys, I believe.

1390
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,930
But lots of other species
since then, including

1391
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,310
dolphins, including whales.

1392
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:43,750
And what you see is-- in
the aftermath of a fight,

1393
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:47,840
you see two individuals are
more likely-- in gorillas,

1394
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,170
for example, to do social
grooming in the aftermath--

1395
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:52,560
than at any other time.

1396
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,930
An increased rate of that
happening-- reconciliation.

1397
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:00,620
What's remarkable is some
of the subtleties in it.

1398
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,340
And this was work that was done
by Marina Cords, at Columbia.

1399
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,320
And what she showed was,
the odds of reconciliation

1400
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,910
increase when it's
a more important,

1401
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:14,050
valuable relationship
that you have.

1402
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:16,610
How was she showing this?

1403
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:19,410
These were studies
with macaque monkeys.

1404
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:21,700
And what she did was
set up circumstances--

1405
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,970
these were animals
that were caged.

1406
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,180
And there were
circumstances where

1407
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:31,520
she put food on a tray outside
that could be reached for.

1408
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,900
Where, in one setting,
an animal could

1409
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,080
get the food in all on its own.

1410
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,790
And in another
setting, the only way

1411
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:40,570
to get the food tray
close enough to the cage

1412
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,640
was if both of them cooperated.

1413
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,890
And this was what they
were doing habitually.

1414
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,480
So what's the difference, there?

1415
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,420
In the second case,
you have formed

1416
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,780
this cooperative relationship
with this other individual.

1417
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,280
You need them, and they
need you to pull off

1418
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,590
this getting the food
close to the cage business.

1419
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,520
What she showed was
significantly higher rates

1420
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,950
of reconciliation
between pairs that

1421
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,440
have a history of cooperating.

1422
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,530
What could that
be interpreted as?

1423
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,840
More of a game-theory
history of cooperation

1424
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,210
behind you-- more
willingness to forgive.

1425
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,770
Another way of framing it,
as she does in her work,

1426
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,830
is, this is a more valuable
relationship that you

1427
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,260
don't want to screw up.

1428
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,540
You are more willing to do
something reconciliative

1429
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,200
afterward.

1430
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,330
You can see, in baboons,
reconciling behavior

1431
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,710
in females.

1432
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:32,370
No male baboons ever reconcile.

1433
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:34,690
Showing gender
differences, there.

1434
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,840
In bonobos, you
see reconciliation

1435
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,090
is different from all
these other species, where,

1436
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:43,314
in all the other ones, it's
built around social grooming

1437
01:06:43,314 --> 01:06:45,770
or chimp hugs or whatever.

1438
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,710
There, of course, as you
guessed it, it's sex.

1439
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,230
Because with the
bonobos, anything

1440
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:52,860
that happens, and
it's time to have sex.

1441
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,730
But an interesting
thing, in terms

1442
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:58,940
of this picture of bonobos
being this incredibly peaceful

1443
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,810
species out there in this
commune and all of that--

1444
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:06,840
you can't have reconciliation
unless you have aggression.

1445
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,600
They do have aggressive
interactions.

1446
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,680
Otherwise, there would be
nothing to reconcile afterward.

1447
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,900
Even the beatific bonobos have
a certain degree of aggression--

1448
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,640
very high and varied
rates, varied abilities,

1449
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:23,340
to pull off reconciliative
behavior afterward.

1450
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,900
More things that used
to be just about us.

1451
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,030
Empathy.

1452
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:30,180
And a literature now coming
out, showing the building

1453
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:33,050
blocks of that in
other species, as well.

1454
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:38,670
First example in chimps,
second example in lab rats.

1455
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,550
Chimp example.

1456
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,280
Again, this was work
done by Frans de Waal.

1457
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,760
And wonderful study.

1458
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,270
What he showed were
two circumstances

1459
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,430
where a male chimp
would get pummeled.

1460
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,000
First circumstance.

1461
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,340
You've got this low-ranking
male who goes up and threatens

1462
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,550
and starts a fight with
a higher-ranking male

1463
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,330
and gets pummeled
into the ground.

1464
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,700
Second circumstance.

1465
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,100
Low-ranking guy
is sitting there,

1466
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,310
minding his own business.

1467
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,260
High-ranking guy
is in a bad mood

1468
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,430
and pummels him into the ground.

1469
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:08,680
What's the difference?

1470
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,760
In the first case,
this kid started it,

1471
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,985
by challenging the guy.

1472
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:16,750
And in the second case, he
was an innocent bystander.

1473
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,490
And what de Waal showed
is, in the half hour

1474
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:23,310
after these incidents, the ones
who were innocent bystanders

1475
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:27,300
were far more likely to be
groomed by females there

1476
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,770
in the group than the
ones who had started it.

1477
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:33,550
They were able to distinguish
between not just that this

1478
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:35,810
is an individual
who just got pounded

1479
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:38,819
but whether it was their
fault or not, or whether they

1480
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:39,890
were a victim.

1481
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:43,430
And considerably more grooming
when it was an individual who

1482
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:44,670
had been a victim.

1483
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:49,200
Something resembling some
proto empathy happening, there.

1484
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,779
Remarkable study, published
in Science a couple years ago.

1485
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:54,040
A group from McGill.

1486
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,310
And what they showed was
arguing this is something

1487
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,850
resembling empathy in rats.

1488
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,430
Here's what they
showed in the study.

1489
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,585
What they had was, they-- let's
see, how were they doing that?

1490
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:11,689
They would have one rat
that was restrained.

1491
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,340
And rats don't like it.

1492
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:17,090
And they would be giving
off ultrasonic alarm calls.

1493
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,950
Now you put a second
rat, and you give them

1494
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,890
a pain-threshold test.

1495
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:25,240
Which is to say, you put them
on a perfectly cool surface,

1496
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,149
and you begin to
warm it up, and you

1497
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:29,520
see at what temperature
do they first

1498
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,224
lift up one of their paws.

1499
01:09:31,224 --> 01:09:32,890
And, quick, take them
off at that point.

1500
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,069
And what is their
temperature threshold

1501
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:37,540
for beginning to
find this aversive?

1502
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:42,310
And what they showed was that
rats would have a lowered

1503
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,290
threshold, would be more
sensitive to this pain

1504
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:48,689
stimulus, if they were next
door to another rat giving off

1505
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:51,410
alarm vocalizations.

1506
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,490
But it was more
subtle than that.

1507
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:57,260
That would be easily described
in terms of, OK, alarm calls,

1508
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,600
and stressful, and just putting
me in a more agitated state.

1509
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,410
What they showed was,
this only worked when it

1510
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:06,460
was rats that were cagemates.

1511
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,010
If it's rats that knew
each other, hearing

1512
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:13,100
the other rat in distress made
you more sensitive to a pain

1513
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,060
stimulus.

1514
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:18,035
If it was a strange rat,
it didn't work at all.

1515
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:21,920
Some crude version of something
resembling empathy, there.

1516
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,680
So we're not the
only species with it.

1517
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,850
What's clear, though, is we
are the only species that

1518
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,900
could take it to
just domains that

1519
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,830
are utterly unrecognizable.

1520
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:35,180
We are the only
species that is moved

1521
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,760
by people on the other side
of the planet who have just

1522
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,440
been in some catastrophe.

1523
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:44,400
We are the only species moved by
artwork that depicts suffering,

1524
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,440
by movie characters, by
fictional characters in books.

1525
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,780
We are taken into realms
that are unmatched elsewhere.

1526
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,680
There's this wonderful video.

1527
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,990
This was an
advertisement for Ikea.

1528
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:00,996
Has anyone seen this one, where
the light gets thrown out?

1529
01:11:00,996 --> 01:11:03,680
Is there anyone
who hasn't seen it?

1530
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,260
OK, this is-- opens up.

1531
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,920
It's this stormy, like,
dismal, drizzling night, there.

1532
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,510
And it's clearly freezing.

1533
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,400
And you see-- coming
into an apartment,

1534
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,960
you see an old
lamp sitting there,

1535
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,492
with sort of a
neck-type lamp thing.

1536
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:21,450
And it's sitting there.

1537
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:24,660
And suddenly this person
appears, picks it up,

1538
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:28,150
and walks outside into
the rain and puts it

1539
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,370
down next to the garbage can.

1540
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:30,900
Oh!

1541
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,310
It's being thrown out.

1542
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:35,750
And now, thanks to brilliant
photography and angles

1543
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,200
that are shot just
underneath the lamp,

1544
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,540
there, you see it leaning there,
looking miserable in the rain

1545
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,490
and all alone with its
light thing, there.

1546
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,770
And you see, from this
angle in the background,

1547
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:47,490
there's the
apartment, where it's

1548
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,720
warm-- lights, and all of that.

1549
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,370
And then you see the
most heartbreaking thing.

1550
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:55,670
You see the person come by the
window, there-- the armchair--

1551
01:11:55,670 --> 01:12:00,290
and put down a new lamp--
a new lamp that's nicer.

1552
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,490
And they even show the person--
just to really get the edge,

1553
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,170
there-- briefly
caressing the new lamp.

1554
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:08,850
And then you get a shot
back out again in the dark,

1555
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:11,050
and it's pouring, and
it's drizzling out.

1556
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:13,300
And you're sitting
there, feeling terrible

1557
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,980
for this damned lamp, there.

1558
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,370
How does this work?

1559
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:19,250
And then, just to sort of
show it, suddenly this person

1560
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,560
appears in the screen
and says, in effect,

1561
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,820
what's wrong with you?

1562
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,010
It's a lamp.

1563
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:26,910
It's a lamp, and the
new one works better.

1564
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:29,890
And then on comes
"Ikea," which I suspect

1565
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,400
is not actually a good strategy,
because you think of them

1566
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,260
as heartless
individuals who advocate

1567
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,810
the abandonment of child lamps.

1568
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:41,192
But, like, no hippo
would know what

1569
01:12:41,192 --> 01:12:43,400
the deal is, while you're
sitting there feeling sorry

1570
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,270
for this piece of metal, there.

1571
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:48,650
We have empathy--
not the only species,

1572
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:52,180
but in very distinct
and unique realms.

1573
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,780
What else?

1574
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,030
We are ostensibly
the only species

1575
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:57,810
with a sense of justice.

1576
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:01,070
Again, that's not
necessarily the case.

1577
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:04,320
Again, work by Frans de Waal,
whose name keeps coming up,

1578
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,600
who is one of the best,
most creative primatologists

1579
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,640
in the universe.

1580
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,000
This is work, now, where, again,
chimps-- two chimps-- where

1581
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,850
circumstances were,
either it takes

1582
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:17,660
one of them to pull
a tray of food over,

1583
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:21,080
or both of them to cooperate
in order to get the food.

1584
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,140
And what he shows is, after
the cooperative relationship

1585
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,080
has been established
with them, if you

1586
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,540
change the workings of it
that it requires both of them

1587
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:32,170
to pull the food in
but the food winds

1588
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:34,740
up going to only
one of the chimps,

1589
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,010
that champ is more
likely to share

1590
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:39,260
the food with the
other individual

1591
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:42,600
than if they didn't have a
working-together relationship.

1592
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,030
That chimp, on some Frans
de Waal sort of level,

1593
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:49,900
was feeling bad for the other
guy getting a rotten deal.

1594
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:53,030
Under those circumstances, if
it was a chimp that you already

1595
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:55,800
had a cooperative
relationship with,

1596
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,730
you were more likely
to share with them

1597
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:01,940
after they had gotten something
aversive occur to them.

1598
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,260
What else?

1599
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:06,480
What else, in terms of making
sense of other species--

1600
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,260
what are unique, what are not?

1601
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,470
Dominance hierarchies.

1602
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:13,580
And if you come from a
certain school of sociology,

1603
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:17,160
humans are the least
hierarchical species out there.

1604
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,470
We are not territorial, in the
sense of lots of other species.

1605
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,500
We do not have
strict hierarchies.

1606
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,280
And what you see
in other species

1607
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,220
are hierarchies can mean
very different things.

1608
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,420
And the broad
dichotomy that's made

1609
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:33,740
is between top-down
hierarchies and bottom-up ones.

1610
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:38,090
Top-down, you have a single,
dominating, most aggressive

1611
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,220
individual who is
up there on top.

1612
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:42,280
And the characteristic
of this-- it's also

1613
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,390
called a "despotic"
hierarchy-- is

1614
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:49,620
extremely unequal
distribution of resources

1615
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:54,220
enforced by violence or
threats of violence from above.

1616
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,490
That's baboons.

1617
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,700
That's chimps.

1618
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,350
That's rhesus monkeys.

1619
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,680
Then you look at
vervet monkeys, and you

1620
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,200
see a bottom-up, what is
also termed "egalitarian,"

1621
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,200
hierarchy.

1622
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,020
There is a hierarchy, but the
number one individual there

1623
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:12,230
is only there with the
cooperation of everyone else.

1624
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:15,850
If that individual becomes
abusive, they are overthrown.

1625
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,300
So hierarchy does
not, in other species,

1626
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:22,700
automatically mean abusive,
aggressive, dominating,

1627
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,730
unequal-distribution stuff.

1628
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:28,020
What it is is, it
varies by species.

1629
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,890
What also becomes clear,
by the time you're

1630
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:32,410
looking at other
species, is it gets

1631
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:36,590
really hard to figure out what
does indeed count as violence.

1632
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:41,280
Example-- East African primate
called a "patas" monkey.

1633
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,650
Go and study patas
monkeys, and spend 40, 50,

1634
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:47,050
60 years doing it,
and what you will see

1635
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:50,760
are virtually no instances
of male patas monkeys

1636
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,320
having fights with each other.

1637
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,110
Wow!

1638
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:55,810
That's a pretty
unaggressive species.

1639
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,280
That's kind of nice.

1640
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,060
Put two male patas
monkeys in a cage,

1641
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,340
and not only will they start
fighting soon afterward,

1642
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,440
they will fight to the death.

1643
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:10,990
Because they have no signals
of terminating aggression.

1644
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,940
What's the deal with that?

1645
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:17,190
This is a species where the
level of male-male tension

1646
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,990
and male-male
aggression is so high

1647
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,870
that the entire social
structure of these species

1648
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,460
are built around keeping males
as far apart as possible.

1649
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,510
You don't see male
patas monkeys having

1650
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,690
fights, not because
they're not aggressive

1651
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:33,880
but because they live in
these dispersed patterns.

1652
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,590
So is this an aggressive
species, or not?

1653
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:39,360
This isn't an aggressive
species; you never see a fight.

1654
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,590
This is an insanely
aggressive species;

1655
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,660
the central feature of
their social structure

1656
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,760
is keeping violent males
away from each other.

1657
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,980
What does it count as?

1658
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,660
What does it count as
when you see an animal

1659
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:54,230
leap on top of another
animal and rip it to shreds?

1660
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:56,320
Sometimes that's
aggression, sometimes

1661
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,800
that's getting dinner.

1662
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,660
Once again, as with the
sexual-behavior realm--

1663
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:04,760
this whole realm, back
to the limbic anatomy of,

1664
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,320
are you looking at aggression?

1665
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,970
Are you looking at predation?

1666
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:10,830
These are totally different
biological phenomena.

1667
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,150
That takes some work.

1668
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,710
What has always been
one of the big questions

1669
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,040
in the field is,
so, what's the deal

1670
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,190
with rough-and-tumble play?

1671
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:20,440
What's play about?

1672
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,470
Because you see it in
endless species out there.

1673
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:26,320
A lot of studies show that
during periods of famine,

1674
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,760
for example, one of
the last behaviors that

1675
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,060
disappears from kids is play.

1676
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,270
It is really, really
hard-wired in there.

1677
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:38,210
So when you see aggressive
play, is this truly aggression,

1678
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:41,090
or is this practicing
the building blocks

1679
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:44,080
for the real stuff that
will come later on?

1680
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,760
What a lot of the
primate studies

1681
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,090
suggest is, it's not
practice, it's not play,

1682
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:52,510
it's already establishing
some of the asymmetries that

1683
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:55,160
will be there later in life.

1684
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:55,820
OK.

1685
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,670
So, all sorts of ways
in which aggression

1686
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:01,530
can pop up in other species,
in unexpected realms,

1687
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,840
in which cooperation,
all sorts of things

1688
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,510
like that-- what are some
of the unique human ones?

1689
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:09,800
Nonetheless, amid all
those similarities,

1690
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,490
we do things that are
completely unprecedented.

1691
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,780
We are perfectly
capable of being

1692
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,920
as violent as a chimp, when
it comes to cudgeling somebody

1693
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,850
over the head.

1694
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,100
But we're the only
species that could

1695
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,500
be violent by doing nothing
more physically taxing then

1696
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:30,330
pulling a trigger or looking
the other away or releasing

1697
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,080
a bomb from 30,000
feet up in the air

1698
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,560
or being passive-aggressive
or damning with faint praise.

1699
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,550
And we're suddenly doing
all sorts of much more

1700
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,490
subtle things with aggression.

1701
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,730
Here's three examples
of human aggression--

1702
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,970
and I've heard
about-- which shows

1703
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:52,720
just how complex of a
phenomenon this could be.

1704
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,230
First one.

1705
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,000
This was the child
of a friend of mine,

1706
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,870
when she was about
five years old

1707
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:00,550
and she was in kindergarten
or pre-K or something.

1708
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:02,880
And there was another kid
there that she was not

1709
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,000
getting along with.

1710
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,540
And this was around Easter, and
they were painting Easter eggs.

1711
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,100
And some tussle came
up between them.

1712
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,720
And my friend's daughter broke
the other kid's Easter egg.

1713
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,450
Tears, hysteria, teachers
swooping in to say,

1714
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:20,240
you're not a bad child but
you've done a bad thing,

1715
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,740
and you can't do
stuff like that.

1716
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,780
And you are going to paint a
new Easter egg, to give to her,

1717
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:28,630
to make up for the
one that you broke.

1718
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,970
So my friend's kid proceeds
to go to the corner

1719
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,180
with this new egg and
some paintbrushes.

1720
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,737
And what becomes apparent
after a while is she's sort of,

1721
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,320
like, looking over her shoulder
and working away on something,

1722
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,380
here, and glowering
back at everybody.

1723
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,980
And finally she comes
up to the other kid

1724
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,180
and says, here's your stupid
Easter egg, Happy Easter,

1725
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:49,352
and gives her an egg that
she's painted completely black.

1726
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,140
[LAUGHTER]

1727
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,210
OK.

1728
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:54,390
What's with the
aggression, here?

1729
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:57,920
Easter eggs--
pastel colors, bunny

1730
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,130
rabbits-- all that
sort of thing.

1731
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:04,410
Easter eggs are not supposed
to be one solid color

1732
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:06,650
and certainly not jet black.

1733
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:09,190
That's not what-- what
was she doing, here?

1734
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,850
She was cooperating with
the letter of the law

1735
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:14,740
while doing as much violence
to the spirit of the law as

1736
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:15,530
possible.

1737
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:18,240
What she was saying
was, she is making

1738
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,210
me paint this egg for you, and
I don't like you one bit more

1739
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,500
than 30 minutes ago.

1740
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,490
And, showing that
the other kid fully

1741
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:27,160
understood what this human
bit of passive-aggression

1742
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,130
was about, she burst into tears
as soon as she saw the egg.

1743
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:35,360
Next example of the subtlety
of human aggression.

1744
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,774
And this one involved my wife.

1745
01:20:38,774 --> 01:20:39,273
OK.

1746
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:40,200
[LAUGHTER]

1747
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,090
So this was-- occasion.

1748
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:45,147
We were, like, driving
around somewhere-- minivan,

1749
01:20:45,147 --> 01:20:45,730
with our kids.

1750
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:49,410
And some total jerk,
like, cut us off.

1751
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,800
And-- you know, he could
have killed us and our kids,

1752
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,700
and-- [GROWL OF FRUSTRATION].

1753
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:55,780
My wife was driving.

1754
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:58,050
And we sort of get past
what should logically

1755
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:00,590
have been about five seconds
of cursing the person.

1756
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:04,362
And she suddenly says,
I'm going after this guy.

1757
01:21:04,362 --> 01:21:05,760
[LAUGHTER]

1758
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,970
And she proceeds
to trail the guy

1759
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:10,699
and trails him for
about two miles,

1760
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,990
while I'm sitting there
getting increasingly distressed

1761
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,430
and panicked.

1762
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:17,019
And eventually
he, like, realizes

1763
01:21:17,019 --> 01:21:18,560
he's being followed
now and is taking

1764
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,050
sort of evasive maneuvers.

1765
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:23,130
And eventually we get
him on this street

1766
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:24,910
where there's a red
light, there, where

1767
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,857
there's a car in front of him.

1768
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:27,940
And then we're behind him.

1769
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,680
So it's not like he
could, in a panic,

1770
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:32,570
go through the red light, there,
because he's trapped there.

1771
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,779
And we happen to know this
was a very long red light.

1772
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:37,153
While I've been sitting there,
for the last five minutes,

1773
01:21:37,153 --> 01:21:38,800
saying, um, do you
think this is really

1774
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,620
a good-- [VROOM] go
around another corner,

1775
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,650
tracking him down.

1776
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:43,680
So we're sitting there.

1777
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,710
And suddenly my wife says,
I'm going over there.

1778
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:49,290
And she grabs something from
between the seats and storms

1779
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:49,400
out.

1780
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,600
While I say, um, do you
really think that's a good--

1781
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,220
[LAUGHTER]

1782
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:52,720
She's gone.

1783
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,010
So I, like, get out,
and I run over there.

1784
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,090
And I see the window's
down in the car.

1785
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:59,110
And she's yelling at the guy.

1786
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,800
And she says, anybody
who could do something

1787
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,780
like that needs this.

1788
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,380
And she flings something at him.

1789
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,710
So she comes back to
the car, at that point.

1790
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,860
And the light has changed.

1791
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:12,680
And this guy, like,
slinks off into the--

1792
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,290
if it is possible for a car to
look sheepish, moving, like,

1793
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:19,010
four miles an hour, heads
off into the sunset,

1794
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:21,380
down this dark,
little block, there.

1795
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,660
So, sitting there.

1796
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,220
And she's milking this
for all it's worth.

1797
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,970
And turn-- what did
you put in there?

1798
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:31,370
And she looks totally
delighted with herself.

1799
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,620
And she's, like, euphoric.

1800
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,880
And I said, well, what
did you say to him?

1801
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,900
You-- what was
that-- and she said,

1802
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,745
anyone that could do anything
this mean needs one of these.

1803
01:22:40,745 --> 01:22:42,120
And I said, what
did you do then?

1804
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,986
And she said, I threw
a lollipop at him.

1805
01:22:44,986 --> 01:22:45,486
[LAUGHTER]

1806
01:22:45,486 --> 01:22:47,210
I said, whoa!

1807
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,625
You killer, you!

1808
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:51,130
You-- I was so proud of her.

1809
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:54,570
My god, the violence
intrinsic in that!

1810
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:58,080
No other species would know
what was that going on, there,

1811
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,780
in terms of the intrinsic
passive-aggression

1812
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:04,459
and all of that.

1813
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:06,000
We're the only ones
who could come up

1814
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,020
with something like that.

1815
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,550
Third example.

1816
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:14,220
Every day, out in
Nevada, in a town there,

1817
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:17,910
there are men who get
up to go off to work,

1818
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,850
and they kiss the
family goodbye.

1819
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:24,140
And they've got to get reminded
to pick up the dry cleaning.

1820
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,527
And they get in the car, and
they're a little bit late,

1821
01:23:26,527 --> 01:23:28,110
and there's a lot
of traffic, and they

1822
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:30,250
get all stressed
about the traffic jam.

1823
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,300
But they get there
to work on time.

1824
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,290
And they're a little
bit relaxed there.

1825
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:35,950
And they finally can come in.

1826
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:38,440
And they sit down
in a chair in what

1827
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,350
is a model of the cockpit
of a fighter plane.

1828
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,570
And what they do is
control drone airplanes

1829
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:48,120
on the other side of
the planet, in Iraq.

1830
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,815
And they spend the
day, sitting there

1831
01:23:49,815 --> 01:23:52,460
at their work shift,
controlling planes that

1832
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,330
release bombs and missiles
and destroy people

1833
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:58,450
12,000 miles away.

1834
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,240
So they spend the
entire day, sitting

1835
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:05,880
there in this air-conditioned
room in Nevis Air Force Base,

1836
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,540
just outside Las Vegas.

1837
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,500
And they spend the
day doing that.

1838
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,980
And at the end of the
day, they pick up,

1839
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,030
and they tell everyone
they'll see them tomorrow.

1840
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:16,840
And they go pick up
the dry cleaning.

1841
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,140
And they go to their little
daughter's ballet concert.

1842
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,170
And afterward they
hug her and can't

1843
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,310
believe they could love
somebody this much.

1844
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,060
And then the next
morning they go

1845
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,080
back to spending their
day killing people

1846
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,390
on the other side of the planet.

1847
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:33,630
There is not a whole
lot of species out there

1848
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:35,620
who could do that, either.

1849
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,470
So by the time
you're getting to us,

1850
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:42,120
we have ways of being awful to
other members of our species

1851
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,972
that are simply unmatched.

1852
01:24:43,972 --> 01:24:47,020
And we have ways of
being empathic, as well.

1853
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:50,450
As we begin to wrestle,
here, with the neurobiology

1854
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:52,980
and endocrinology and
finally walking our way back

1855
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:56,630
towards the left, we're going
to have this huge problem

1856
01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:01,310
of the context of aggression and
this even huger problem of just

1857
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:04,700
how complex aggression
and empathy are,

1858
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,950
when you leave it to humans.

1859
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,540
Examples at the empathy end.

1860
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,140
Human versions of it.

1861
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,630
The things we are
able to reconcile.

1862
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:15,830
We are a species
who has invented

1863
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:20,410
truth-and-reconciliation
commissions in South Africa,

1864
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:24,870
in the Balkans, in Rwanda,
where people face the person who

1865
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:29,160
did that to them, the person who
destroyed their life, destroyed

1866
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,150
their family.

1867
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:33,390
And going through what is by
now a fairly well-worked-out

1868
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:36,530
process that all sorts
of people have studied.

1869
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:40,720
And, in some of those cases,
there is reconciliation.

1870
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,010
There is even forgiveness.

1871
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:45,700
How can this possibly happen?

1872
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,240
We have a world where we
try to have individuals

1873
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:54,230
foster peace through the
most unlikely of rationales.

1874
01:25:54,230 --> 01:26:00,100
I will let no man spoil my
soul by causing me to hate him.

1875
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,510
That is a psychology
that is unprecedented.

1876
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:09,040
We have the world of people like
this Catholic nun, Sister Helen

1877
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,780
Prejean, who has spent
her entire career

1878
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:14,570
ministering to the needs
of men on death row

1879
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:17,370
in a maximum-security
prison in Louisiana.

1880
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:19,580
She was the person who
was featured in the movie

1881
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,640
way back when, Dead Man Walking.

1882
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,390
And what she spent a
lot of her time doing

1883
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:27,180
is having incredulous
people, often

1884
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,600
the relatives of the
victims of these murderers,

1885
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,630
come up and say,
how can you do this?

1886
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:36,550
How could you spend your life
devoted to people like these?

1887
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:38,560
And she comes up
with an answer that

1888
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:43,130
is so definedly human, that no
other species could come near.

1889
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:45,720
No matter how much
they groom victims,

1890
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:49,760
her answer always is, the
less forgivable the act,

1891
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,730
the more it must be forgiven.

1892
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:56,310
The less lovable the person,
the more they must be loved.

1893
01:26:56,310 --> 01:27:00,140
And suddenly we're in a world
that the more something cannot

1894
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:04,900
be, the more it must be, as
a moral sort of act to do.

1895
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,750
Whoa-- nobody out there
in the animal kingdom

1896
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:10,090
is going to have a
clue what we're up to.

1897
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,930
This is very complex
terrain we are

1898
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:15,510
going to deal with, here,
as we now shift over

1899
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,741
to the biology of it.

1900
01:27:17,741 --> 01:27:18,240
OK.

1901
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,330
So, starting now
with our strategy--

1902
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:22,000
a violent act occurs.

1903
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,870
An empathic act occurs.

1904
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,490
Any in these categories.

1905
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,045
What was going on in the
brain, one second before?

1906
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:30,420
And, of course,
what do you know?

1907
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,700
We're going to immediately
going to land is,

1908
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,940
right in the middle
of the limbic system.

1909
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,530
And, just as the Kluver-Bucy
syndrome from the 1980s,

1910
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:42,520
as we heard about last
week-- just as that syndrome,

1911
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,480
when you destroy
the limbic system,

1912
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,390
you get completely inappropriate
sexual behavior in primates.

1913
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:50,260
What those studies
also showed was,

1914
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,640
you get completely inappropriate
aggressive behavior.

1915
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,520
OK.

1916
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,090
So, with 80-year-old
research, we've

1917
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:59,060
now landed in the limbic system.

1918
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:02,230
What are the subregions
that are relevant?

1919
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:05,030
The area that comes in
at the top of the list,

1920
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,400
immediately, that we've already
heard a fair amount about,

1921
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,210
is the amygdala.

1922
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:13,260
The amygdala and
its role in fear,

1923
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,410
its role in anxiety--
that strange role,

1924
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:18,590
in males, of sexual motivation.

1925
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,730
But what the amygdala
is most renowned for

1926
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:22,770
is its role in aggression.

1927
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,830
And, as I emphasized
last week, it

1928
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:27,700
is mighty interesting,
I think, that the part

1929
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,700
of the brain which is most
responsive to when you are

1930
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,730
scared is the part
of the brain that

1931
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:35,390
generates the starts
of aggressive behavior.

1932
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:39,710
Again, in a world in which
no neuron need be afraid,

1933
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:43,480
we're going to have a lot fewer
aggressive amygdalas out there.

1934
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,530
What's the evidence?

1935
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:46,460
You know the drill by now.

1936
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:49,700
You go and you destroy
the amygdala in an animal,

1937
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:54,400
and you are incapable of
eliciting aggression from them.

1938
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,300
You go and you do the
same thing in a human,

1939
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,630
and you get the
exact same result.

1940
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:02,200
One of those dark,
horrible chapters

1941
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,810
in the history of
science-- another realm

1942
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:08,270
of legally enforced
psychosurgery.

1943
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:11,410
This was a trend that
was very, very popular

1944
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:15,300
in the '60s and '70s--
court-ordered amygdalectomies

1945
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,510
of people.

1946
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:18,450
And this was a
technique where people

1947
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:22,620
would go in with a lesioning
syringe into each side--

1948
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:25,610
the amygdala is a bilateral
structure-- there's

1949
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,600
two of them, way
deep in the brain--

1950
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,540
and go in and destroy
the structure.

1951
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:34,020
And this would
decrease aggression.

1952
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:36,800
This would decrease
all sorts of stuff.

1953
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,170
This wound up on the front
page of the New York Times

1954
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:44,910
when, around 1970, three
neurosurgeons at Harvard

1955
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:48,450
wrote a letter to the New
York Times, pointing out

1956
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,810
there's this great
surgical technique

1957
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:52,810
which they were the
pioneers of where

1958
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,960
you could take aggressive
humans and make

1959
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,100
them less aggressive with
no other side effects.

1960
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,750
You could make them
less aggressive.

1961
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:03,250
And haven't you been noticing
that our inner cities have been

1962
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,390
burning and rife with violence?

1963
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:07,930
Maybe it's time to start
thinking about doing

1964
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:10,130
some of these preemptively.

1965
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:12,910
This was a letter
from these three guys

1966
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:14,680
from Harvard Med School.

1967
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,580
No surprise, not
everybody sort of

1968
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:19,390
thought this was the swellest
idea that they had ever heard.

1969
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:24,120
This generated this huge fight
over the psychosurgical use

1970
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:27,230
of court-enforced
amygdalectomies.

1971
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:30,630
And before it was over with,
it had just as bad of a history

1972
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:32,450
as frontal lobotomies.

1973
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:35,150
People subjected
to amygdalectomies

1974
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:40,200
because they were argumentative,
because they, as teenagers,

1975
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,780
didn't listen to their parents.

1976
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,650
They didn't listen
to their teachers.

1977
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:45,900
Thousands of cases of these.

1978
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,780
The one thing that was
clear was that, yes, indeed,

1979
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:52,070
aggressive behavior would
decrease in these individuals.

1980
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:55,070
There would not be a whole lot
of a person left afterward.

1981
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:57,390
So, lesioning evidence.

1982
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,930
Stimulation evidence.

1983
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,940
You know the flip
side of that by now.

1984
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:03,800
Now stick an electrode
into the rat's amygdala

1985
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,650
and stimulate, electrically
stimulate, there.

1986
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:11,040
And you produce wildly
aggressive behavior.

1987
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,470
And you see two equivalents
of that in humans.

1988
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:18,540
And in both of these
cases, stupendously rare.

1989
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:22,310
First is a very,
very, very rare type

1990
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,170
of epilepsy, where
what you get is

1991
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:28,850
the epileptic focus, the place
where the seizure begins,

1992
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,380
is in the amygdala.

1993
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:33,720
What you see is, with
most types of epilepsy,

1994
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,960
the place where it starts
in the brain, a seizure,

1995
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,980
tells you a whole lot about
matching with the behavior.

1996
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,620
People, just before the
onset of the seizure,

1997
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:45,320
will get olfactory
auras-- two or three

1998
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,400
seconds of
hallucinating an odor.

1999
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,260
That's a seizure that's
starting somewhere down

2000
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:54,040
in the olfactory part
of the limbic system.

2001
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,860
You see all sorts of cases.

2002
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,650
There have been documented
cases of epileptics

2003
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:02,110
who see a mathematical
equation for two seconds

2004
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,780
before the seizure hits.

2005
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:06,560
And that's an area of the
cortex where it turns up.

2006
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,210
Auditory seizures, where they
hear two measures of music--

2007
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:12,390
the same two measures
before it hits.

2008
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:15,870
What you see when you've got
these rare epilepsies, where

2009
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:18,320
the seizure begins
in the amygdala, is,

2010
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:22,316
two seconds before, the
person becomes furious.

2011
01:32:22,316 --> 01:32:29,020
They-- I can't bel-- I am so
ang-- and then it happens.

2012
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,520
So, uncontrolled stimulation
in the amygdala, and you

2013
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,240
get some aggression there.

2014
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,610
The next thing that
you see is evidence

2015
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:38,661
of the amygdaloid stimulation.

2016
01:32:38,661 --> 01:32:39,160
OK.

2017
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,882
Anybody ever hear of a
guy named Charles Whitman?

2018
01:32:41,882 --> 01:32:44,770


2019
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:48,510
Hands-- oh, what are they
teaching you guys, here?

2020
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,010
OK.

2021
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:53,290
Charles Whitman was once
America's record-holding mass

2022
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:54,310
murderer.

2023
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:57,840
And he was the best
that we could come up

2024
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,510
with in the early 1960s.

2025
01:32:59,510 --> 01:33:01,480
And, oh, his records
have been eclipsed

2026
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,290
by so many people since then.

2027
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:06,830
But he was once our
gold-medal mass murderer.

2028
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:10,280
This was the guy who,
in 1962, I think,

2029
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:14,440
climbed up the famed clock tower
at the University of Texas,

2030
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:18,400
Austin, campus and opened
fire on people below.

2031
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,980
And then killed
himself, afterward.

2032
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:24,000
This was the first of the
rounding up the neighbors

2033
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,050
to say, oh my god, he
was such a quiet guy-- he

2034
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:28,460
was such a nice neighbor.

2035
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:33,030
This was the first of the
literal choirboys-- my god,

2036
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:35,520
where did this come from--
no hint of anything.

2037
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,250
On postmortem, he was found to
have a tumor in his amygdala.

2038
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,910
Another rare case of that.

2039
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:47,200
During the 1970s, there was an
extreme leftist terrorist group

2040
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,340
in Germany called the
Baader-Meinhof gang.

2041
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:52,610
And these were the two
people who began it.

2042
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:58,220
And one of the two stupendously
violent people-- one of the two

2043
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:02,890
found, on postmortem, to
have a tumor in her amygdala.

2044
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:06,140
So these very, very
rare cases of this,

2045
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,460
fitting with this
theme-- circumstances

2046
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:11,690
that increase the
metabolism in the amygdala.

2047
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:14,220
Out comes aggressive behavior.

2048
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:15,380
More evidence.

2049
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:18,190
Now, another strategy
from the limbic lectures.

2050
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,420
Put in the electrode.

2051
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,530
This is one that responds
to electrical signaling.

2052
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:24,500
Show somebody
something that evokes

2053
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,920
aggression, and their
amygdala has gotten activated.

2054
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,650
Do the same thing,
now, with a human.

2055
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:32,330
Put them in a brain
scanner, and show them

2056
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:34,170
something that evokes anger.

2057
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:38,580
And the metabolic rate in
their amygdala activates.

2058
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:41,480
So you see all sorts
of circumstances

2059
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:47,080
where you can document the
amygdala as playing this role.

2060
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,480
Interestingly, the amygdala
gets bigger, as we've heard,

2061
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:52,610
in people with posttraumatic
stress disorder.

2062
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:56,090
And what you see there
is also increased

2063
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,600
frequency of violent behavior.

2064
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,500
More evidence that the amygdala
plays a role-- and this

2065
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,550
was a very subtle finding.

2066
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:08,890
This was from-- oh my god,
the clock in the back!

2067
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:11,210
Turn around and
look at that clock.

2068
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:15,010
[LAUGHTER]

2069
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:17,860


2070
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:19,130
Everybody run!

2071
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,390
[LAUGHTER]

2072
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:22,040
OK, well, now that
it's almost done,

2073
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,010
I'll mention the very
last thing, here.

2074
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,940
These were studies
done showing-- OK,

2075
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,240
people with amygdaloid
lesions, they

2076
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:34,780
are very bad at detecting faces
expressing angry emotions.

2077
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:39,270
They are more trusting of people
than average individuals are.

2078
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:41,710
They are more likely to forgive.

2079
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:45,060
They are less capable of picking
up on any of that information.

2080
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:48,640
And a wonderful study done by
this guy, Antonio Damasio--

2081
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,600
again, one of the lead
figures in the field.

2082
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,190
What he did was eye tracking on
people with amygdaloid lesions.

2083
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:58,380
You get someone with this
part of the brain destroyed,

2084
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:01,060
and they don't look at
the eyes of other people.

2085
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:04,320
When they examine faces,
they're looking at the nose.

2086
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,910
They're looking at the chin.

2087
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:10,130
They're not directing their gaze
to be able to pick up accurate

2088
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:12,680
information about emotions.

2089
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,100
So what do we see, here?

2090
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:17,780
The amygdala not only
responds to aggression

2091
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,700
and fear-provoking stimuli.

2092
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:23,320
The amygdala is able to
direct you to look for it.

2093
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,000
And what we will
see on Wednesday is,

2094
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,040
one of the things
testosterone does in males

2095
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,730
is it makes them look harder.

2096
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:33,260
It lowers their
threshold for deciding

2097
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:37,240
that ambiguous
information is, in fact--

2098
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:40,510
